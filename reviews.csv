","I don't have a comic book background (well I did sixty years ago), so I go into these films without predispositions. This was highly touted because of the title black superhero. And so I embraced it because I like it when barriers are broken. The problem was that the thing was convoluted and endless. I stayed with it to the bitter end but found little to make it unique among its Marvel brotherhood. If anything, it pulled in every cliche one could think of, having a black hero. Maybe the producers will learn from this and bring the guy back. By the way, it didn't deserve all those ""One"" ratings. There were some incredible scenes. It just didn't meld."
" I wish I enjoyed it like so many did, it just bored me.

","I feel so bad giving this film a poor rating, because I feel it's important for many reasons, socially, culturally, so important to finally see a principally black cast lead the way in the year's biggest movie event.Dazzling special effects, great acting, but aside from that I couldn't say much in favour of the film, if I'm being totally honest it bored me throughout, I yawned the whole way through, as everything in this movie has been literally done to death, it lacked pace, it lacked energy, it was hard to stay engaged.I saw it based on the many wonderful and positive reviews, maybe I was having an off day, it just bored me to tears. It's interesting, but all of the critics seemed to rave about it.I want to give huge credit to Chadwick Boseman though, he was great here, what a brave man, RIP.3/10."

","After the death of his father, Prince T'Challa ascends to the throne of the small African country of Wakanda. T'Challa is also Black Panther, superhero. Now not only must he govern his country but defeat a dangerous adversary.An average comic book / superhero movie, which doesn't say much. Massively over-hyped and over-praised, largely because of the racial angle. What you have is ultimately nothing new: the usual action and CGI-centric storyline, the basic, wafer-thin plot, the token character development, i.e. just another Avengers-type movie.This is not a revolutionary movie in terms of breaking stereotypes - if you're looking for that, watch In The Heat Of The Night (1967), or any one of several Sidney Poitier movies, instead."

",I am between a 5 and a 6 on this. It was vastly overrated by the professional reviewers. I am sure their reviews were politically motivated. I loved the cast but I agree that characters were superficial and not defined as they should have been. I also feel more humor was needed in the movie. This can't compare to other Marvel movies. It's a one shot deal for us. We don't need to hear any more preaching.
" Absolutely Overrated

5/10
","""Black Panther"" is a great deception for any viewer with brains. The hype creates expectation but the film is absolutely overrated. The plot and the characters are shallow and senseless. The Wakanda society accepts the dispute for the kingdom between the outsider Erik Killmonger and T'Challa without any plebiscite. The villain defeats T'Challa is a fair fight as per the Rules. Then Tchalla´s mother, sister and girlfriend recover him using the powerful plant destined to Wakanda kings. And T'Challa returns to Wakanda in a coup d'état, destroying the aircrafts sent by Killmonger to the spies. W'Kabi and his army support Killmonger and in the end, it seems that everything is all right in Wakanda that seems to have a great division between the social classes. There is also excessive references to the ""birth of mankind"" in the view of the writer. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Pantera Negra"" (""Black Panther"")"

","I guess, because of the hype, I was expecting ""the best Marvel movie ever,"" or at least ""the best Marvel movie if the year.""I pray to God and Stan Lee that this isn't the best Marvel Movie of 2018.The fact is, there are maybe 3 laughs in the entire film. Three moments where you smile. Three moments where you crack a grin and they all come exclusively from Letitia Wright.And it wasn't because there were jokes and they didn't land. It was really because the movie took itself far too seriously. Like Winter Soldier and Civil War it had a message to tell...but unlike the Captain American movies, it thought its message was so serious that it couldn't laugh even at itself.I think, honestly, it even forgot it was a Marvel movie. In fact at time I think that the director, crew, and cast all thought that they were making ""Roots"" meets the new ""A Birth of a Nation""And Martin Freedman, yeah I think he was only there to prove that he could do a better American accent than his Sherlock counterpart. Maybe it was a bet, which part of the cast of Sherlock can hold an American accent throughout an entire film?And, honestly I am disappointed, because ALL three grins in the film went to Letitia Wright and Martin Freeman has some fairly decent comedic timing...they just didn't let it show. At least not for Freeman or ANYONE ELSE.Honestly, I'm surprised they even let Letitia Wright makes us smile or entertain us an any way.Honestly, it felt a lot like I was watching a college lecture...but a college lecture for a class that has a mandatory attendance policy and a professor that ONLY teaches from the book that he himself wrote...you get that kind of overly-serious pretentious feel to it.And...really, how often do people have to tell other people who they are in this movie? That really happened far too often and not in the ""Bond, James Bond"" way but in the ""If I tell you who I am it's going to give me extra power"" kind of way.And in the end you get two fight scenes by a waterfall that weren't very inspired and failed in comparison to other MCU fights. You get a car chase that was again...uninspired and fell flat but this time in the ""we've seen this before only done better"" kind of way. And a climatic battle that felt a little like the Gungan/Battle Droid battle in The Phantom Menace only with better CGI and an uninspired fight between the two powers rather than the Jedi dual.At least Winter Soldier and Civil War allowed us to laugh and relax a bit during the more serious MCU fair. At least they pulled out the stops when it came to action and, despite the message...tried to deliver something, anything.All this gave us was, well, a lecture and one where the action seemed, well, it seemed like the cast and crew felt they were obligated to give us that and thus did it with disdain.. It felt like all involved thought that entertainment would take away from the preaching.And really, have a message....just please entertain me. I work hard. I already went to school. What I want for the price of admission is to be entertained.If you can't do that, if you only let Letitia Wright make me smile and then only three times in a super hero movie that doesn't wow with action...then you've failed.In fact, you've failed so much that you aren't ""the first Black super-hero movie"" I'm taking that pilfered title and giving it back to Blade...because at least Blade was entertaining."

","First of all before anyone calls me racist on the other side of the screen I am a melinated person. I'm a huge MCU fan too. Black Panther outside of the movie is a cool badass character.Anyways this movie has a great story at the same time it is underwhelming. The acting and costumes were marvelous. Very traditional and technology feel.
But that does not mean it's automatically the best movie or a great movie. Visuals and ""panther"" power is not enough.The over hypeness made this movie look bad. It could have been more dramatic on so many levels. It could have been THE MOVIE but was not.The movie rushes to make Killmonger king who becomes king for less than a day. T'Challa is in a coma for less than a few hours. Then the movie just rushes to a fight and that's about it.This movie lacks drama, dialogue and development. The over hypeness from fans, media and band-wagoners is what kills this movie from being higher than a 5.I suppose Mcu fans and many black people were just ill during the time of the release to notice the flaws of this hash.This movie could be so much more but with the MCU formula we have to settle for subpar movies.Black Panther is one of the most overrated movies of all time . Black Panther isn't the first Black Superhero to make it to the big screen, get that through your head. So where was all this hype coming from? And Why?
Black Panther is not a good movie.I recommend this movie to the brainwashed.Verdict: The Pantah and T'challa are great characters. It's just this movie was hash."

","Wanted to see 'Black Panther' for a while, one of my most anticipated films of this early half of 2018 and as somebody who likes to loves most of Marvel's films. The idea was interesting as was what the film was hyped up to be, the trailer looked great and the high ratings and critical acclaim promised even more. My thoughts were that 'Black Panther' was a decent and intriguing film with a lot of very well done to great elements, but it didn't blow me away and left me disappointed after the hype. As indicated, far from hated it, didn't love it. Actually saw 'Black Panther' on opening weekend in a sold out showing (it was touch and go as to whether a ticket could be gotten), but had to properly form my thoughts for a while and was nervous seeing the very divisive IMDb reaction and the condescension on both sides (mostly negative), which has slightly died down since to feel less nervous.Starting with the good/great things, 'Black Panther' is mostly impressive visually. The special effects were variable, but there were some spectacular ones, while it's beautifully and stylishly shot, slickly edited and sumptuously costumed. It's the extraordinary production design that was most note-worthy. Loved the use of technology, which was really cool. The music has the right amount of haunting intensity, energy, dignity and pathos, so a fine score on its own but not always utilised right in the film, a few ill-fitting moments mood-wise.Much of the action is exciting, though there could have been more, and there is a good deal of thought-provoking script-writing with some nicely injected humour. One is immersed in the world of Wakanda, which is a fascinating world in thematic terms. The story does grip once it gets going and doesn't feel as confused and jumpy, with timeline and location changes needing to be clearer, like it did to begin with and a lot of it even when turning our everyday struggles on their heads is surprisingly relevant. Personally thought that much of the acting was good, with a very charismatic lead performance from Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan bringing a self-loathing conflicted edge and swagger to Killmonger and Andy Serkis relishing his role with aplomb. The women are just as good, with a dignified Lupita Nyong'o, regal, no-nonsense and feisty Danai Gurira and particularly a funny and endearing Letitia Wright. While his role is small, Daniel Kaluuya is great fun in it. Direction is above competent, if not innovative, and really appreciated the film making Killmonger more than the standard Marvel villain, here one with questionable personal motives but one where one can see his point of view and empathise. Although his actions are inconsistent and don't always make sense and he could have been more threatening, generally he is one of the better Marvel villains and the most developed character in a film too full of stock ones (the titular character being the other exception). 'Black Panther' has faults however. Most of the characters are stock and clichéd, while some of the first half is too talky, the film is a little slow-going and confused to start with and some of the political elements are laid on too thick. Adding to the general feel that, even with the splashes of humour, the film takes itself too seriously and with the amount of predictability it has doesn't do enough new with a novel concept. There are exceptions to the cast. Forrest Whittaker is wasted as a non-developed character with too short screen time, on top of the scene being rushed his final scene has no impact as a result. Martin Freeman is too fish out of water as well. Although some of the effects are spectacular, others are very ropy. Especially in the final action scene between Black Panther and Killmonger which resembled a very early days/years video game. That scene also felt rushed, sometimes vaguely choreographed and anti-climactic, though the whole climax felt over-stuffed and too busy. Overall, decent and interesting but was expecting more. Personally don't think it's the best Marvel film, while a long way from bad let alone terrible, for me it's one of the weaker ones. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
" Most overrated MCU movie and extremely generic

","I managed to see this movie again during the weekend, preparing for Captain Marvel, and I felt I had to do a review on this movie. Especially since Cap was such a great movie in comparison.Black Panther is not only the most overrated MCU movie so far, I would go so far as to say it is one of the most overrated movies of all time.
It is not horrible bad per se, it is just so darn boring.
The reason it is so boring is partly because it is super generic - bad guy wants hero´s stuff/title, bad guy fights good guy and ""wins"", good guy comes back reinforced/trained/equipped or with allies and wins in the end. That is it. That is the movie. Which would be fine-ish if the movie had something else to offer, but except for clothing and music, it does not.
The second reason this movie is so boring is because there is no excitment - the movie is so predictable that after 10min I could tell you exactly what would happen. Well, I did not know that the villain, who is the most Hitleresque character I have seen in a movie, had ancestors jumping into the sea dying because they wanted to be free. He was Wakandan, no slaves there.. so what was he talking about?But yes, lets talk villains. Claw was great for the time he was in the movie, and the Rhino dude had decent motivation so okay I will buy that. But the main villain of the story want to spread weapons, conquer, and save people that ""look like him"". All in a nationalistic very neo-fascist fashion. Almost all of his speaches mimic Hitler, if you do not believe me, check out a clip of Hitler and compare. Uncanny likeness. And this is a villain so many can relate to? Weird.Something else that stod out was the bad CGi, what happen Marvel? Why suddenly so bad computer graphics? The two CGi suits fighting in the end took me so far out of the movie that I starting to think of what to eat for lunch the day after.And finally this is the most political Marvel movie to date. In some aspects I both expected it and can think it is necessary - it is very hard to talk Africa in this context and not mention slavery. HOWEVER, In the MCU, Wakanda is located just north of Lake Turkana, at a point bordering Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, and South Sudan. Do you know who took slaves there historically? It was not white men, nor christians... so... why was that not mention?
And the wall thingie at the end, was that really necessary? Felt out of place, out of character, and too much on the nose.I give this a 3/10, and I think Black Panther is the second or third worst Marvel movie so far. As part of that universe it should perhaps not be overlooked by fans, but otherwise I cannot recommend this at all. So, so boring movie. Even The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, all of the Thor movies, hell even Justice League, was more fun then this. Not bad, just bland, boring, predictable, extremely generic, and did I mention boring?"
" Disappointing

","This was supposed to be the newest and best Marvel movie. It was also supposed to be deeper than a super hero movie. Well, basically all they did was put African-Americans in the role of the main characters and followed the same exact formula of every other Marvel movie ever created. The action was mediocre at best. The villain was good, but at the point when he truly started to flesh out his character, I was bored and realized I was watching a movie. I literally said what was going to happen about 30 minutes before it happened. Now if you like super hero films, which I happen to not but if you do I am sure you will have fun and enjoy this film. But, in my opinion this movie had th intensity of a haircut and was a boring commercial to sell toys."
" Meh, highly overrated - not even close to ""the best"" Marvel movie

","The cinematography of this film was just OK with some obvious bad CGI, and one would come to expect something better from a Marvel superhero film (as shown by the budget). The directing was fairly decent.The story was ok, but nothing overly exciting. Way too much spotlight on the Black Panther conflict here. I feel the story would have been better told had there been another villain. The acting also seemed either way too overboard for some of the characters, while others under-performed.Nevertheless, enjoyable, but certainly not even close to ""the best"" Marvel movie. It's only a 6/10 from me."

","With all the hype surrounding this movie (excellent trailers, Kendrick-curated soundtrack, all-African cast) I thought I was in for something special with Black Panther, as while they aren't remotely the highest quality movies, the Marvel cinematic universe movies are generally pretty entertaining. As it turns out I was wrong, Black Panther was extremely average, I have no idea what these critics/review bots are talking about when they say that it is the best Marvel movie and worthy of ""critical"" praise (as not just a super hero movie but as a movie in general.)Things that I liked:
Effort put into aesthetic authenticity of the African elements of the movie - within the Marvel universe the look and feel of the movie was unique and you can tell care was taken in this regard.Andy Serkis - My favorite character by far, was probably the only person who didnt seem like he was reading from a script sheet and got some genuine laughs out of me.Things that I didn't like:
The story was extremely predictable and to be honest I don't know if the most virtuous resolution was reached in the climax. Michael B Jordan's character had fairly reasonable intentions for wanting to kill the Black Panther and take his place in Wakanda as he had been abandoned, with seemingly no family, to live in the ghettos of Oakland. However, his whole plan to give advanced Wakandan weaponry to every African person in the world so they could kill and overthrow people in power who weren't African was extremely ""on-the-chin"" in terms of its narrative motivations within the current climate. It wasn't remotely clever or nuanced and really unbalanced his character, his motivations were understandable but his plan was moronic. Additionally, who didn't see Black Panther surviving his fall? Who didn't see the Gorilla tribe coming to the rescue at the end? The entire movie was so bland and predictable I wanted it to be over well before the end - I didn't even stay for the post credit scenes...The acting was very wooden - Not a lot to say here really, some really poor line delivery from the cast across the board except for Andy Serkis. No one was particularly charismatic, the main character for instance was extremely boring.The script was very robotic - This ties into the poor acting, but perhaps as a result of the script, some of the actors never really had a chance to bring their characters to life.The characters - I have already addressed the mess that was Michael B Jordan's character Warmonger(?). Basically throughout the entire movie you never really learn anything or see anything of the Black Panther's character, he basically moves from one place to another showing no emotion and just either smashes things or asks people questions. Apparently the character is supposed to be very intelligent, while it was probably a narrative choice, the Black Panther in this movie seemed like an emotionless Jarhead whose only really characteristic was that he get nervous around his girlfriend... The women in this movie had a bit of attitude and charisma and shouldn't be blanketed down with the Black Panther and Warmonger as bad characters, but they didnt really get a chance to shine and really only contributed a few one liners and a bit of fighting.The action - Shaky-cam rubbish, the action in the movie is terrible and not remotely on the level of the well-choreographed fighting in say Captain America Winter Soldier - please for the love of god show someone getting punched or kicked without having to cut the shot 5 times. There is an action sequence at the start which basically flagposted what the action was going to be like, it is shot at night and you basically cant see bloody anything...The CGI - Honestly, the CGI in Black Panther felt extrmely overused and was surprisingly quite bad. It really took me out of some scenes because the environments and effects looked average (not quite Justice League bad but not far off). It is obvious in scenes in Wakanda, for instance, where the plains/mountains are in the background but they are clearly filming in front of a green screen. Some of the effects just looked silly and got laughs out of me and my party. I personally though the Rhinos were stupid...The Soundtrack - After all the hype surrounding Kendrick Lamar curating a soundtrack for the movie, the tracks from that album barely feature at all. They faintly play from some cars and stuff here and there and a couple feature in some action scenes but I though we would be watching some decent action scenes with some bass heavy Kendrick blasting along to the fighting. Alas, no dice. The orchestral score is also quite average, coming in strong at weird moments and being quite out of place in certain places, there are a couple of moments where it seems like some sort of fairy, Harry Potter, Narnia music that just doesn't fit the scene.Overall I think this is probably one of the weaker Marvel movies, avoiding honest criticism because of the hype surrounding it. The basic components of the film are all poor-average, with the only real 5+/10 aspect being the aesthetics of Wakanda and its people. Like I said above, I wanted to leave well before it was over because I knew the action was probably not going to improve from nauseating shaky-cam and I knew how it was all going to play out."
" Wishful thinking / Broken ratings / Longread

","First, this movie has a lot of pointless scenes that achieve nothing, the museum scene with pointless covert operation ending up in killing everyone anyway, that's so not Silent Assassin. The 007 Bond casino scene was just there to establish the most worthless character in movie history - Everett K. Ross. After the capture of Klaue (surprisingly surviving a horrible car crash), we get another pointless scene where Killmonger and his girlfriend re-capture Klaue just to kill him again for no reason. Killmonger never actually needed Klaue in the first place, so killing him was as pointless as freeing him out. Killmonger also kills his GF for no particular reason yet again. He could've easily get to Wakanda anyway since he has the royal tattoo (they also gave those to vampire servants in Blade). Then Killmonger and Black Panther participate in previously established variety of local Mak'Gora (election process I guess). Black Panther fails miserably and the new stronger king takes the throne, the end, right? No. They actually want you to root for the most useless and impotent king ever. Killmonger then says something stupid about colonization and oppression, and decides to use the Vibranium weapons (produced solely by a 16 y.o. girl mastermind) to conquer the world. So he's like pro-anti-colonization or something, you tell me. Yet he is betrayed by his people (Okoye literally says she will stay loyal to the king and in 5 minutes betrays the new king) and they all happily participate in a civil war slaughter until Killmonger gets killed. Also love how they intercepted their own ships with their own people, just murdering them. There was also some sort of brother betrayal, but it was so shallow and lacking motivation that it isn't really worth discussing. The brother (I think) wanted to have some more action and so he betrayed the king just to lower his weapons and suffer a life sentence afterwards. After slaughtering his own people, everything gets back to normal. And the king who solves all problems with violence decides to share his tech and knowledge to help the world. But not like the whole world, mostly African-american people in the US. I'm sure it's going to be pretty easy, since all technology in this world is done by one genius girl.Then we get the first post-credit scene when BP visits the UN assembly and says that he is ready to share the knowledge with all the nations. I'm pretty sure that we already have a lot of knowledge on slaughtering each other in wars and even civil wars, so his knowledge is not going to make a great difference.Summing it up, we get a weak impotent king to hold his throne. He never cared about anyone besides himself really, the fact that he suggests to heal Killmonger who killed Zuri just for lulz shows that he doesn't care. He never cares about his own people since he never hesitated on killing them personally. Just a little advice, if you wan't to have a good king character, ask Llane Wrynn how to rule.Killmonger was driven by revenge at first, then his motivation turned into some uncertain political position about oppression, but in the end it seems that he just loved his country (but not the people, it seems). The scene where BP suggests that Killmonger can be saved and healed completely destroys all the rivalry and the motivation of both. Anyway, Killmonger and Klaue were the best characters in the movie. The story was nonsense, they achieved nothing , BP leaned nothing and is still a worthless king and a bad leader. Was nice to see Serkis having a lot of fun in this movie, I love that guy and I'd love to see more of him (guess he's tired of playing CGI puppets...Gollum...Gollum).I also loved all the wishful thinking in this movie, which is mostly based on the comic I guess. Advanced native African people with space technology saving the world? Any educated person would suggest you checking South Africa after 1994. Supporting the immigrants in the US? Come on, guys...The good stuff: even though there were just 3 sets of Wakanda I still kinda loved it, the music choice was good, showing all that traditionalism, the nature. Killmonger's scene with his father was gold, I wish we had more dramatic scenes (it was well acted and well executed overall). The sister was kinda cool sometimes, being a more modern character and rejecting the old ways. Even though she's a little too much Mary Sue.Yet the main reason why I still decided to write this is the reviews. This has to stop. And I'm not talking solely about RT 97% which is just ridiculous. It's like people are afraid to judge something impartially cause of getting shamed for being racist or something. Also, this movie started with fair 7.1 on IMDB later to be loaded with >30% of 10 ratings eventually ending up in 7.9 (as of now, I'm sure it will only go up). I'm not saying that IMDB has something to do with this, but this rating surely does not reflect the quality of the movie.Conclusion: don't trust ratings (nor RT or IMDB). If you like it - like it, if you don't - no need to be afraid to say that you didn't like it.You know you've seen a good movie when you exit the theater with something changed inside, an emotion, a thought - BP is not such a movie."

","Chadwick Boseman who played a pair of real live black icons and played them
well makes a reappearance as T'Changa whom we met in Captain American
Civil War. Jackie Robinson and Thurgood Marshall should only have had the

could have been done in Hollywood's golden era. But I think the real reason
these films are so popular is that real life isn't providing us with that many
heroes to admire. Sure easier to root for Marvel Comics creation.Anyway Boseman's father died and being the crown prince he's the logical
successor. But in the hidden kingdom of Wakanda you can get challenged.
Something like the way the Klingons choose their leader. Boseman defeats
one challenger, but another one, an exile raised in the mean streets of Oakland played by Michael B. Jordan emerges and he takes over for a bit.
Boseman is down, but not out.Kids and Trekkie types will certainly love this. Not my particular cup of tea,
but it's nicely done and packaged.The only question I have is that if these Wakandans are as powerful as they
are, why weren't the first Arab slave traders repelled let alone European buyers? Seems like that was the time to make their presence known."

","With all the hype surrounding this movie, I must admit that I had expected something extraordinary.However the ""Black Panther"" movie was not all as outstanding as it was cranked up to be. Don't get me wrong here, because I am not saying the movie is bad. Far from it as it was still rather enjoyable. It just wasn't outstanding amidst the many Marvel movies that flood the movie market.The storyline in ""Black Panther"" was adequate, albeit somewhat generic and predictable.The acting in the movie was good and they really had gotten together a great ensemble of actors and actresses to perform in the movie. Personally, then I was most impressed with Andy Serkis, and it was quite nice to see him in person and not doing blue-suit performances.The action was fast paced and well-choreographed, which definitely added to the overall enjoyment of the movie.This being a Marvel superhero movie, of course you expect a grand visual presentation of CGI.

Likable rooting characters but in general, there was a lack of interest. The story line felt as if we have seen before. The plot isn't quite as refreshing or unique as originally thought, and at times was somewhat boring.We can see as to how and why many people have considered this film to be overrated and not nearly as great as its critics are founding over. Perhaps this is one of those films where we need to have interest in the culture and overall character landmark to fully feel connected. In the end, one was left disappointed."

In general, this movie is fine, as I have stated earlier, but the truth is that the professional critics have judge this movie for the wrong reasons, they have let their political interests overshadow their ability to rate a movie the way it's supposed to be.In conclusion, this movie is completely overrated, also, definitely not the best movie of the year, not even in the top ten, not even the best movie of superheroes of this year and even though the academy nominated it for best picture it is still overrated. If you want to watch a really good superheroe movie and a really good movie in general I suggest The Dark Knight not Black panther."

","This is my second attempt to review this title. 
I was able to see a screening of this in Europe...waste of time. Predictable and laughable at points, it desperately tries to keep pace with other Marvel offerings but fails miserably. The storyline begins with an extremely promising origin for the characters but instead of capitalizing on this and building on it we move to forced action sequences that are poorly done (horrible CGI). That's where the attempt to keep pace with other Marvel and DC offerings becomes obvious...cliché phrases and over the top reaches to create new ones. Some borrowing from previous Marvel ""technology"" really tried to claim it to it's own, but was sadly obvious. Jordan did an outstanding job portraying Erik Killmonger and Whitaker was great, as always...the rest of the cast fell miles short of bringing these characters to life. It's okay to act with a chip on your shoulder because THAT'S what make hero characters pop...BUT you must act first. As the Marvel scene is beginning to become over saturated, this film at least allows us to take a break from an actual Marvel film.Not good enough to call ""cookie cutter""..."

","Academy award nominee for best picture? All I can say is, if this is the best example of an action film that has been produced that is actually worthy of a nomination for best picture than this has to be one of the worst years (2018) ever in the history of the film making industry. I mean, as far as a Marvel action film goes, this is definitely above average. The generally anticipated saturation of CGI (Computer Graphics Interface) technology was actually bearable, but the fight scenes were dragged out far too long.Try and imagine a John Wayne western fight being dragged out for as long as the last fight in this movie was which takes place between cousins T'Challa / Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and the super buff and shirtless Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan). John Wayne enjoyed a long and illustrious career in many film genres and one of the ways he accomplished that was by making sure none of his fight scenes dragged on too long. So a little advice for my bro's Chadwick and Michael B. ""ya gotta no when to hold 'em, and know when to fold 'em"".Mrs. Shullivan and I liked that the women warriors were all strong, black and beautiful women with a head on their shoulders and did not bend for any man, King or no King. The power struggle to mainatin the rare earth minerals, the civil war between the five (5) tribes, and the earlier scene where the young girls were being treated like cargo vaguely reminds us about what has transpired on the African continent over the past century. But kids won't get it, and adults want to see positive reinforcements without weaponizing the tribes.It's a decent enough Marvel film, but I don't think it will be on my ""repeat"" list to watch anytime soon. I give the film a 6 out of 10 rating. Please don't disappoint us with any further bad choice Academy Award winners."

","This thing is being over-hyped to the max. The narrative is promising at the outset, but fails miserably as it deteriorates into the absurd, and then continues to drip like Chinese water torture from the poorly written screenplay. The acting was mostly amateurish with the exception of Forest Whitaker, who seemed out of his element, but the screenplay could very well be the culprit here. The entire production was a laughable exercise in nonsense, and the CGI was worse."

","Black Panther, directed by Ryan Coogler, tells the story of the new King T'Challa of Wakanda who must learn to handle the responsibilities of this title. Chadwick Boseman reprises his role as the Black Panther and goes up against his nemesis Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan.Pros:
Coogler has already proven himself to be an excellent director after movies like Fruitvale Station and Creed (both starring Jordan), but he showcases his full talents in Black Panther when given a huge budget to work with. The movie looks beautiful with bright lush colors. The soundtrack and musical score are also very good. At its heart, the movie's message is very profound and relevant to real world politics.As expected, Boseman is awesome as T'Challa. His character goes through so much and his development throughout is handled perfectly. The best scenes of this movie are when he has to look within himself to find answers when the people he always trusted let him down. The cast in general has very good chemistry. T'Challa's relationship with his sister Shuri (Letiitia Wright) is very funny and it's easy to buy them as siblings. His relationship with his love Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) is even better. It would be criminal not to mention Danai Gurira and what she gives this movie from an action standpoint. Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger is without a doubt the best villain the MCU has presented so far. His motivations are so clear and his ideology directly challenges T'Challa's. He is physically and psychologically the perfect adversary for Black Panther. Cons:
The pacing of the movie is a bit odd. It moves pretty quickly until everything comes to a head at the very end. More time should have been spent in between to flesh out the side characters and let the emotions sink in. In addition, the action scenes are not among Marvel's best. The last battle between Panther and Killmonger in particular is pretty disappointing in all honesty. The CGI felt unfinished and they could have been cut together better. Overall, Black Panther is a triumph for the MCU and its societal connotations. This is, in my opinion, the best origin movie that Marvel has made because of its amazing hero, great cast of role characters, and truly menacing villain. Black Panther gets an A."

","Marvel fantasy origin film. Based in 'Wakanda', which is an African fantasy location. The source of the population vast wealth, and advanced technology is an ancient cosmic metal called 'nonsenseanium' The plot is poor, the acting is wooden, with no humour and hardly any action. We see how the 'Lion King Simba' rip-off becomes king and is challenged by the 'Scar' rip-off for his throne. The film has been over-hyped and not as good as the reviews lead you to believe, it appears that reviews are being cautious of giving honest criticism in fear of being called racist!I didn't much like Wonder Woman either, but this isn't even as good as that.
Overly long (134 minutes), very disappointing and boring."

","Subpar to say the least. Political partisanship has now cemented its ugly head into almost every movie being delivered for mass consumption. Most moviegoers such as myself take in a flick to escape today's overt political nonsense and everybody's got an agenda world we live in........even if only for a couple hours. Forget about it. Not going to happen. For me there is so much effort to preach (as that's what it is) a particular political viewpoint that it totally interferes with story and character development. Because of this I found Black Panther almost unbearable and struggled to make it to the end. Besides that, technically the CGI was wayyyy off and character development severely compromised. Just awful. Possibly the most undeservingly overhyped movie of all time."

","Black Panther was the very first black superhero in any main stream comic book to date appearing in 1966, obviously it was a big deal.As a white male, I absolutely love this character, the one from the comics I mean, and not the MCU version, mainly because of all the political agendas that are strewn through the picture, All I can say is enough is enough. Black people are the best race ever we get it, everyone is entitled to there own opinions, just don't push it on the viewers. I appreciate what was trying to be done but everything else is just drowned out by all the BS. And the really crappy character development and poor cgi that plagues the screen, along with all the comic book errors made throughout, like Erik gaining powers from consuming the heart shaped herb. Let me be very clear I absolutely love Chadwick Bozeman as the Black Panther in Civil War, i'm ashamed that not even his talents as an actor, could save this awful mess, and Andy Serkis was awesome as usual, a waste of potential. Overall it has decent moments here and there, but nothing new or relevant, not a good movie period."

","I don't have a comic book background (well I did sixty years ago), so I go into these films without predispositions. This was highly touted because of the title black superhero. And so I embraced it because I like it when barriers are broken. The problem was that the thing was convoluted and endless. I stayed with it to the bitter end but found little to make it unique among its Marvel brotherhood. If anything, it pulled in every cliche one could think of, having a black hero. Maybe the producers will learn from this and bring the guy back. By the way, it didn't deserve all those ""One"" ratings. There were some incredible scenes. It just didn't meld."

It's interesting, but all of the critics seemed to rave about it.I want to give huge credit to Chadwick Boseman though, he was great here, what a brave man, RIP.3/10."

Massively over-hyped and over-praised, largely because of the racial angle. What you have is ultimately nothing new: the usual action and CGI-centric storyline, the basic, wafer-thin plot, the token character development, i.e. just another Avengers-type movie.This is not a revolutionary movie in terms of breaking stereotypes - if you're looking for that, watch In The Heat Of The Night (1967), or any one of several Sidney Poitier movies, instead."

","""Black Panther"" is a great deception for any viewer with brains. The hype creates expectation but the film is absolutely overrated. The plot and the characters are shallow and senseless. The Wakanda society accepts the dispute for the kingdom between the outsider Erik Killmonger and T'Challa without any plebiscite. The villain defeats T'Challa is a fair fight as per the Rules. Then Tchalla´s mother, sister and girlfriend recover him using the powerful plant destined to Wakanda kings. And T'Challa returns to Wakanda in a coup d'état, destroying the aircrafts sent by Killmonger to the spies. W'Kabi and his army support Killmonger and in the end, it seems that everything is all right in Wakanda that seems to have a great division between the social classes. There is also excessive references to the ""birth of mankind"" in the view of the writer. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Pantera Negra"" (""Black Panther"")"

","I guess, because of the hype, I was expecting ""the best Marvel movie ever,"" or at least ""the best Marvel movie if the year.""I pray to God and Stan Lee that this isn't the best Marvel Movie of 2018.The fact is, there are maybe 3 laughs in the entire film. Three moments where you smile. Three moments where you crack a grin and they all come exclusively from Letitia Wright.And it wasn't because there were jokes and they didn't land. It was really because the movie took itself far too seriously. Like Winter Soldier and Civil War it had a message to tell...but unlike the Captain American movies, it thought its message was so serious that it couldn't laugh even at itself.I think, honestly, it even forgot it was a Marvel movie. In fact at time I think that the director, crew, and cast all thought that they were making ""Roots"" meets the new ""A Birth of a Nation""And Martin Freedman, yeah I think he was only there to prove that he could do a better American accent than his Sherlock counterpart. Maybe it was a bet, which part of the cast of Sherlock can hold an American accent throughout an entire film?And, honestly I am disappointed, because ALL three grins in the film went to Letitia Wright and Martin Freeman has some fairly decent comedic timing...they just didn't let it show. At least not for Freeman or ANYONE ELSE.Honestly, I'm surprised they even let Letitia Wright makes us smile or entertain us an any way.Honestly, it felt a lot like I was watching a college lecture...but a college lecture for a class that has a mandatory attendance policy and a professor that ONLY teaches from the book that he himself wrote...you get that kind of overly-serious pretentious feel to it.And...really, how often do people have to tell other people who they are in this movie? That really happened far too often and not in the ""Bond, James Bond"" way but in the ""If I tell you who I am it's going to give me extra power"" kind of way.And in the end you get two fight scenes by a waterfall that weren't very inspired and failed in comparison to other MCU fights. You get a car chase that was again...uninspired and fell flat but this time in the ""we've seen this before only done better"" kind of way. And a climatic battle that felt a little like the Gungan/Battle Droid battle in The Phantom Menace only with better CGI and an uninspired fight between the two powers rather than the Jedi dual.At least Winter Soldier and Civil War allowed us to laugh and relax a bit during the more serious MCU fair. At least they pulled out the stops when it came to action and, despite the message...tried to deliver something, anything.All this gave us was, well, a lecture and one where the action seemed, well, it seemed like the cast and crew felt they were obligated to give us that and thus did it with disdain.. It felt like all involved thought that entertainment would take away from the preaching.And really, have a message....just please entertain me. I work hard. I already went to school. What I want for the price of admission is to be entertained.If you can't do that, if you only let Letitia Wright make me smile and then only three times in a super hero movie that doesn't wow with action...then you've failed.In fact, you've failed so much that you aren't ""the first Black super-hero movie"" I'm taking that pilfered title and giving it back to Blade...because at least Blade was entertaining."

","First of all before anyone calls me racist on the other side of the screen I am a melinated person. I'm a huge MCU fan too. Black Panther outside of the movie is a cool badass character.Anyways this movie has a great story at the same time it is underwhelming. The acting and costumes were marvelous. Very traditional and technology feel.
But that does not mean it's automatically the best movie or a great movie. Visuals and ""panther"" power is not enough.The over hypeness made this movie look bad. It could have been more dramatic on so many levels. It could have been THE MOVIE but was not.The movie rushes to make Killmonger king who becomes king for less than a day. T'Challa is in a coma for less than a few hours. Then the movie just rushes to a fight and that's about it.This movie lacks drama, dialogue and development. The over hypeness from fans, media and band-wagoners is what kills this movie from being higher than a 5.I suppose Mcu fans and many black people were just ill during the time of the release to notice the flaws of this hash.This movie could be so much more but with the MCU formula we have to settle for subpar movies.Black Panther is one of the most overrated movies of all time . Black Panther isn't the first Black Superhero to make it to the big screen, get that through your head. So where was all this hype coming from? And Why?
Black Panther is not a good movie.I recommend this movie to the brainwashed.Verdict: The Pantah and T'challa are great characters. It's just this movie was hash."

","Wanted to see 'Black Panther' for a while, one of my most anticipated films of this early half of 2018 and as somebody who likes to loves most of Marvel's films. The idea was interesting as was what the film was hyped up to be, the trailer looked great and the high ratings and critical acclaim promised even more. My thoughts were that 'Black Panther' was a decent and intriguing film with a lot of very well done to great elements, but it didn't blow me away and left me disappointed after the hype. As indicated, far from hated it, didn't love it. Actually saw 'Black Panther' on opening weekend in a sold out showing (it was touch and go as to whether a ticket could be gotten), but had to properly form my thoughts for a while and was nervous seeing the very divisive IMDb reaction and the condescension on both sides (mostly negative), which has slightly died down since to feel less nervous.Starting with the good/great things, 'Black Panther' is mostly impressive visually. The special effects were variable, but there were some spectacular ones, while it's beautifully and stylishly shot, slickly edited and sumptuously costumed. It's the extraordinary production design that was most note-worthy. Loved the use of technology, which was really cool. The music has the right amount of haunting intensity, energy, dignity and pathos, so a fine score on its own but not always utilised right in the film, a few ill-fitting moments mood-wise.Much of the action is exciting, though there could have been more, and there is a good deal of thought-provoking script-writing with some nicely injected humour. One is immersed in the world of Wakanda, which is a fascinating world in thematic terms. The story does grip once it gets going and doesn't feel as confused and jumpy, with timeline and location changes needing to be clearer, like it did to begin with and a lot of it even when turning our everyday struggles on their heads is surprisingly relevant. Personally thought that much of the acting was good, with a very charismatic lead performance from Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan bringing a self-loathing conflicted edge and swagger to Killmonger and Andy Serkis relishing his role with aplomb. The women are just as good, with a dignified Lupita Nyong'o, regal, no-nonsense and feisty Danai Gurira and particularly a funny and endearing Letitia Wright. While his role is small, Daniel Kaluuya is great fun in it. Direction is above competent, if not innovative, and really appreciated the film making Killmonger more than the standard Marvel villain, here one with questionable personal motives but one where one can see his point of view and empathise. Although his actions are inconsistent and don't always make sense and he could have been more threatening, generally he is one of the better Marvel villains and the most developed character in a film too full of stock ones (the titular character being the other exception). 'Black Panther' has faults however. Most of the characters are stock and clichéd, while some of the first half is too talky, the film is a little slow-going and confused to start with and some of the political elements are laid on too thick. Adding to the general feel that, even with the splashes of humour, the film takes itself too seriously and with the amount of predictability it has doesn't do enough new with a novel concept. There are exceptions to the cast. Forrest Whittaker is wasted as a non-developed character with too short screen time, on top of the scene being rushed his final scene has no impact as a result. Martin Freeman is too fish out of water as well. Although some of the effects are spectacular, others are very ropy. Especially in the final action scene between Black Panther and Killmonger which resembled a very early days/years video game. That scene also felt rushed, sometimes vaguely choreographed and anti-climactic, though the whole climax felt over-stuffed and too busy. Overall, decent and interesting but was expecting more. Personally don't think it's the best Marvel film, while a long way from bad let alone terrible, for me it's one of the weaker ones. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
" Most overrated MCU movie and extremely generic

1/10
","I managed to see this movie again during the weekend, preparing for Captain Marvel, and I felt I had to do a review on this movie. Especially since Cap was such a great movie in comparison.Black Panther is not only the most overrated MCU movie so far, I would go so far as to say it is one of the most overrated movies of all time.
It is not horrible bad per se, it is just so darn boring.
The reason it is so boring is partly because it is super generic - bad guy wants hero´s stuff/title, bad guy fights good guy and ""wins"", good guy comes back reinforced/trained/equipped or with allies and wins in the end. That is it. That is the movie. Which would be fine-ish if the movie had something else to offer, but except for clothing and music, it does not.
The second reason this movie is so boring is because there is no excitment - the movie is so predictable that after 10min I could tell you exactly what would happen. Well, I did not know that the villain, who is the most Hitleresque character I have seen in a movie, had ancestors jumping into the sea dying because they wanted to be free. He was Wakandan, no slaves there.. so what was he talking about?But yes, lets talk villains. Claw was great for the time he was in the movie, and the Rhino dude had decent motivation so okay I will buy that. But the main villain of the story want to spread weapons, conquer, and save people that ""look like him"". All in a nationalistic very neo-fascist fashion. Almost all of his speaches mimic Hitler, if you do not believe me, check out a clip of Hitler and compare. Uncanny likeness. And this is a villain so many can relate to? Weird.Something else that stod out was the bad CGi, what happen Marvel? Why suddenly so bad computer graphics? The two CGi suits fighting in the end took me so far out of the movie that I starting to think of what to eat for lunch the day after.And finally this is the most political Marvel movie to date. In some aspects I both expected it and can think it is necessary - it is very hard to talk Africa in this context and not mention slavery. HOWEVER, In the MCU, Wakanda is located just north of Lake Turkana, at a point bordering Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, and South Sudan. Do you know who took slaves there historically? It was not white men, nor christians... so... why was that not mention?
And the wall thingie at the end, was that really necessary? Felt out of place, out of character, and too much on the nose.I give this a 3/10, and I think Black Panther is the second or third worst Marvel movie so far. As part of that universe it should perhaps not be overlooked by fans, but otherwise I cannot recommend this at all. So, so boring movie. Even The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, all of the Thor movies, hell even Justice League, was more fun then this. Not bad, just bland, boring, predictable, extremely generic, and did I mention boring?"
" Disappointing

2/10
","This was supposed to be the newest and best Marvel movie. It was also supposed to be deeper than a super hero movie. Well, basically all they did was put African-Americans in the role of the main characters and followed the same exact formula of every other Marvel movie ever created. The action was mediocre at best. The villain was good, but at the point when he truly started to flesh out his character, I was bored and realized I was watching a movie. I literally said what was going to happen about 30 minutes before it happened. Now if you like super hero films, which I happen to not but if you do I am sure you will have fun and enjoy this film. But, in my opinion this movie had th intensity of a haircut and was a boring commercial to sell toys."

","The cinematography of this film was just OK with some obvious bad CGI, and one would come to expect something better from a Marvel superhero film (as shown by the budget). The directing was fairly decent.The story was ok, but nothing overly exciting. Way too much spotlight on the Black Panther conflict here. I feel the story would have been better told had there been another villain. The acting also seemed either way too overboard for some of the characters, while others under-performed.Nevertheless, enjoyable, but certainly not even close to ""the best"" Marvel movie. It's only a 6/10 from me."

","With all the hype surrounding this movie (excellent trailers, Kendrick-curated soundtrack, all-African cast) I thought I was in for something special with Black Panther, as while they aren't remotely the highest quality movies, the Marvel cinematic universe movies are generally pretty entertaining. As it turns out I was wrong, Black Panther was extremely average, I have no idea what these critics/review bots are talking about when they say that it is the best Marvel movie and worthy of ""critical"" praise (as not just a super hero movie but as a movie in general.)Things that I liked:
Effort put into aesthetic authenticity of the African elements of the movie - within the Marvel universe the look and feel of the movie was unique and you can tell care was taken in this regard.Andy Serkis - My favorite character by far, was probably the only person who didnt seem like he was reading from a script sheet and got some genuine laughs out of me.Things that I didn't like:
The story was extremely predictable and to be honest I don't know if the most virtuous resolution was reached in the climax. Michael B Jordan's character had fairly reasonable intentions for wanting to kill the Black Panther and take his place in Wakanda as he had been abandoned, with seemingly no family, to live in the ghettos of Oakland. However, his whole plan to give advanced Wakandan weaponry to every African person in the world so they could kill and overthrow people in power who weren't African was extremely ""on-the-chin"" in terms of its narrative motivations within the current climate. It wasn't remotely clever or nuanced and really unbalanced his character, his motivations were understandable but his plan was moronic. Additionally, who didn't see Black Panther surviving his fall? Who didn't see the Gorilla tribe coming to the rescue at the end? The entire movie was so bland and predictable I wanted it to be over well before the end - I didn't even stay for the post credit scenes...The acting was very wooden - Not a lot to say here really, some really poor line delivery from the cast across the board except for Andy Serkis. No one was particularly charismatic, the main character for instance was extremely boring.The script was very robotic - This ties into the poor acting, but perhaps as a result of the script, some of the actors never really had a chance to bring their characters to life.The characters - I have already addressed the mess that was Michael B Jordan's character Warmonger(?). Basically throughout the entire movie you never really learn anything or see anything of the Black Panther's character, he basically moves from one place to another showing no emotion and just either smashes things or asks people questions. Apparently the character is supposed to be very intelligent, while it was probably a narrative choice, the Black Panther in this movie seemed like an emotionless Jarhead whose only really characteristic was that he get nervous around his girlfriend... The women in this movie had a bit of attitude and charisma and shouldn't be blanketed down with the Black Panther and Warmonger as bad characters, but they didnt really get a chance to shine and really only contributed a few one liners and a bit of fighting.The action - Shaky-cam rubbish, the action in the movie is terrible and not remotely on the level of the well-choreographed fighting in say Captain America Winter Soldier - please for the love of god show someone getting punched or kicked without having to cut the shot 5 times. There is an action sequence at the start which basically flagposted what the action was going to be like, it is shot at night and you basically cant see bloody anything...The CGI - Honestly, the CGI in Black Panther felt extrmely overused and was surprisingly quite bad. It really took me out of some scenes because the environments and effects looked average (not quite Justice League bad but not far off). It is obvious in scenes in Wakanda, for instance, where the plains/mountains are in the background but they are clearly filming in front of a green screen. Some of the effects just looked silly and got laughs out of me and my party. I personally though the Rhinos were stupid...The Soundtrack - After all the hype surrounding Kendrick Lamar curating a soundtrack for the movie, the tracks from that album barely feature at all. They faintly play from some cars and stuff here and there and a couple feature in some action scenes but I though we would be watching some decent action scenes with some bass heavy Kendrick blasting along to the fighting. Alas, no dice. The orchestral score is also quite average, coming in strong at weird moments and being quite out of place in certain places, there are a couple of moments where it seems like some sort of fairy, Harry Potter, Narnia music that just doesn't fit the scene.Overall I think this is probably one of the weaker Marvel movies, avoiding honest criticism because of the hype surrounding it. The basic components of the film are all poor-average, with the only real 5+/10 aspect being the aesthetics of Wakanda and its people. Like I said above, I wanted to leave well before it was over because I knew the action was probably not going to improve from nauseating shaky-cam and I knew how it was all going to play out."

","First, this movie has a lot of pointless scenes that achieve nothing, the museum scene with pointless covert operation ending up in killing everyone anyway, that's so not Silent Assassin. The 007 Bond casino scene was just there to establish the most worthless character in movie history - Everett K. Ross. After the capture of Klaue (surprisingly surviving a horrible car crash), we get another pointless scene where Killmonger and his girlfriend re-capture Klaue just to kill him again for no reason. Killmonger never actually needed Klaue in the first place, so killing him was as pointless as freeing him out. Killmonger also kills his GF for no particular reason yet again. He could've easily get to Wakanda anyway since he has the royal tattoo (they also gave those to vampire servants in Blade). Then Killmonger and Black Panther participate in previously established variety of local Mak'Gora (election process I guess). Black Panther fails miserably and the new stronger king takes the throne, the end, right? No. They actually want you to root for the most useless and impotent king ever. Killmonger then says something stupid about colonization and oppression, and decides to use the Vibranium weapons (produced solely by a 16 y.o. girl mastermind) to conquer the world. So he's like pro-anti-colonization or something, you tell me. Yet he is betrayed by his people (Okoye literally says she will stay loyal to the king and in 5 minutes betrays the new king) and they all happily participate in a civil war slaughter until Killmonger gets killed. Also love how they intercepted their own ships with their own people, just murdering them. There was also some sort of brother betrayal, but it was so shallow and lacking motivation that it isn't really worth discussing. The brother (I think) wanted to have some more action and so he betrayed the king just to lower his weapons and suffer a life sentence afterwards. After slaughtering his own people, everything gets back to normal. And the king who solves all problems with violence decides to share his tech and knowledge to help the world. But not like the whole world, mostly African-american people in the US. I'm sure it's going to be pretty easy, since all technology in this world is done by one genius girl.Then we get the first post-credit scene when BP visits the UN assembly and says that he is ready to share the knowledge with all the nations. I'm pretty sure that we already have a lot of knowledge on slaughtering each other in wars and even civil wars, so his knowledge is not going to make a great difference.Summing it up, we get a weak impotent king to hold his throne. He never cared about anyone besides himself really, the fact that he suggests to heal Killmonger who killed Zuri just for lulz shows that he doesn't care. He never cares about his own people since he never hesitated on killing them personally. Just a little advice, if you wan't to have a good king character, ask Llane Wrynn how to rule.Killmonger was driven by revenge at first, then his motivation turned into some uncertain political position about oppression, but in the end it seems that he just loved his country (but not the people, it seems). The scene where BP suggests that Killmonger can be saved and healed completely destroys all the rivalry and the motivation of both. Anyway, Killmonger and Klaue were the best characters in the movie. The story was nonsense, they achieved nothing , BP leaned nothing and is still a worthless king and a bad leader. Was nice to see Serkis having a lot of fun in this movie, I love that guy and I'd love to see more of him (guess he's tired of playing CGI puppets...Gollum...Gollum).I also loved all the wishful thinking in this movie, which is mostly based on the comic I guess. Advanced native African people with space technology saving the world? Any educated person would suggest you checking South Africa after 1994. Supporting the immigrants in the US? Come on, guys...The good stuff: even though there were just 3 sets of Wakanda I still kinda loved it, the music choice was good, showing all that traditionalism, the nature. Killmonger's scene with his father was gold, I wish we had more dramatic scenes (it was well acted and well executed overall). The sister was kinda cool sometimes, being a more modern character and rejecting the old ways. Even though she's a little too much Mary Sue.Yet the main reason why I still decided to write this is the reviews. This has to stop. And I'm not talking solely about RT 97% which is just ridiculous. It's like people are afraid to judge something impartially cause of getting shamed for being racist or something. Also, this movie started with fair 7.1 on IMDB later to be loaded with >30% of 10 ratings eventually ending up in 7.9 (as of now, I'm sure it will only go up). I'm not saying that IMDB has something to do with this, but this rating surely does not reflect the quality of the movie.Conclusion: don't trust ratings (nor RT or IMDB). If you like it - like it, if you don't - no need to be afraid to say that you didn't like it.You know you've seen a good movie when you exit the theater with something changed inside, an emotion, a thought - BP is not such a movie."

","Chadwick Boseman who played a pair of real live black icons and played them
well makes a reappearance as T'Changa whom we met in Captain American
Civil War. Jackie Robinson and Thurgood Marshall should only have had the
superpowers this guy has. Including a mysterious mineral that gives those who use it some real staying power. Kind of like kryptonite.With technological advances we can sure do more with these superheroes than
could have been done in Hollywood's golden era. But I think the real reason
these films are so popular is that real life isn't providing us with that many
heroes to admire. Sure easier to root for Marvel Comics creation.Anyway Boseman's father died and being the crown prince he's the logical
successor. But in the hidden kingdom of Wakanda you can get challenged.
Something like the way the Klingons choose their leader. Boseman defeats
one challenger, but another one, an exile raised in the mean streets of Oakland played by Michael B. Jordan emerges and he takes over for a bit.
Boseman is down, but not out.Kids and Trekkie types will certainly love this. Not my particular cup of tea,
but it's nicely done and packaged.The only question I have is that if these Wakandans are as powerful as they
are, why weren't the first Arab slave traders repelled let alone European buyers? Seems like that was the time to make their presence known."

","With all the hype surrounding this movie, I must admit that I had expected something extraordinary.However the ""Black Panther"" movie was not all as outstanding as it was cranked up to be. Don't get me wrong here, because I am not saying the movie is bad. Far from it as it was still rather enjoyable. It just wasn't outstanding amidst the many Marvel movies that flood the movie market.The storyline in ""Black Panther"" was adequate, albeit somewhat generic and predictable.The acting in the movie was good and they really had gotten together a great ensemble of actors and actresses to perform in the movie. Personally, then I was most impressed with Andy Serkis, and it was quite nice to see him in person and not doing blue-suit performances.The action was fast paced and well-choreographed, which definitely added to the overall enjoyment of the movie.This being a Marvel superhero movie, of course you expect a grand visual presentation of CGI. And let me just say that the CGI in the movie were great, as they always are in these Marvel superhero movies.All in all, an entertaining enough movie. Although not among the top of superhero movies for me."
" Not as interest

6/10
","Having seen the overwhelming critic reviews and overall success and accolades that this film has received, the hype for this Black Panther film was at a height that rarely many superhero films (even films of any genre)have amassed.This film is visually stunning, with great direction, and overall acting. Likable rooting characters but in general, there was a lack of interest. The story line felt as if we have seen before. The plot isn't quite as refreshing or unique as originally thought, and at times was somewhat boring.We can see as to how and why many people have considered this film to be overrated and not nearly as great as its critics are founding over. Perhaps this is one of those films where we need to have interest in the culture and overall character landmark to fully feel connected. In the end, one was left disappointed."

","Although this is a really good movie, it has amazing costumes, they really got the essence of a African cultures, the cast, in general, did a good job, it still had some problems, including, special effects, character development, wasting such an actor as forest Whitaker and a really common narrative superheroe story. In general, this movie is fine, as I have stated earlier, but the truth is that the professional critics have judge this movie for the wrong reasons, they have let their political interests overshadow their ability to rate a movie the way it's supposed to be.In conclusion, this movie is completely overrated, also, definitely not the best movie of the year, not even in the top ten, not even the best movie of superheroes of this year and even though the academy nominated it for best picture it is still overrated. If you want to watch a really good superheroe movie and a really good movie in general I suggest The Dark Knight not Black panther."

","This is my second attempt to review this title. 
I was able to see a screening of this in Europe...waste of time. Predictable and laughable at points, it desperately tries to keep pace with other Marvel offerings but fails miserably. The storyline begins with an extremely promising origin for the characters but instead of capitalizing on this and building on it we move to forced action sequences that are poorly done (horrible CGI). That's where the attempt to keep pace with other Marvel and DC offerings becomes obvious...cliché phrases and over the top reaches to create new ones. Some borrowing from previous Marvel ""technology"" really tried to claim it to it's own, but was sadly obvious. Jordan did an outstanding job portraying Erik Killmonger and Whitaker was great, as always...the rest of the cast fell miles short of bringing these characters to life. It's okay to act with a chip on your shoulder because THAT'S what make hero characters pop...BUT you must act first. As the Marvel scene is beginning to become over saturated, this film at least allows us to take a break from an actual Marvel film.Not good enough to call ""cookie cutter""..."

","Academy award nominee for best picture? All I can say is, if this is the best example of an action film that has been produced that is actually worthy of a nomination for best picture than this has to be one of the worst years (2018) ever in the history of the film making industry. I mean, as far as a Marvel action film goes, this is definitely above average. The generally anticipated saturation of CGI (Computer Graphics Interface) technology was actually bearable, but the fight scenes were dragged out far too long.Try and imagine a John Wayne western fight being dragged out for as long as the last fight in this movie was which takes place between cousins T'Challa / Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and the super buff and shirtless Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan). John Wayne enjoyed a long and illustrious career in many film genres and one of the ways he accomplished that was by making sure none of his fight scenes dragged on too long. So a little advice for my bro's Chadwick and Michael B. ""ya gotta no when to hold 'em, and know when to fold 'em"".Mrs. Shullivan and I liked that the women warriors were all strong, black and beautiful women with a head on their shoulders and did not bend for any man, King or no King. The power struggle to mainatin the rare earth minerals, the civil war between the five (5) tribes, and the earlier scene where the young girls were being treated like cargo vaguely reminds us about what has transpired on the African continent over the past century. But kids won't get it, and adults want to see positive reinforcements without weaponizing the tribes.It's a decent enough Marvel film, but I don't think it will be on my ""repeat"" list to watch anytime soon. I give the film a 6 out of 10 rating. Please don't disappoint us with any further bad choice Academy Award winners."

","This thing is being over-hyped to the max. The narrative is promising at the outset, but fails miserably as it deteriorates into the absurd, and then continues to drip like Chinese water torture from the poorly written screenplay. The acting was mostly amateurish with the exception of Forest Whitaker, who seemed out of his element, but the screenplay could very well be the culprit here. The entire production was a laughable exercise in nonsense, and the CGI was worse."

8/10
","Black Panther, directed by Ryan Coogler, tells the story of the new King T'Challa of Wakanda who must learn to handle the responsibilities of this title. Chadwick Boseman reprises his role as the Black Panther and goes up against his nemesis Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan.Pros:
Coogler has already proven himself to be an excellent director after movies like Fruitvale Station and Creed (both starring Jordan), but he showcases his full talents in Black Panther when given a huge budget to work with. The movie looks beautiful with bright lush colors. The soundtrack and musical score are also very good. At its heart, the movie's message is very profound and relevant to real world politics.As expected, Boseman is awesome as T'Challa. His character goes through so much and his development throughout is handled perfectly. The best scenes of this movie are when he has to look within himself to find answers when the people he always trusted let him down. The cast in general has very good chemistry. T'Challa's relationship with his sister Shuri (Letiitia Wright) is very funny and it's easy to buy them as siblings. His relationship with his love Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) is even better. It would be criminal not to mention Danai Gurira and what she gives this movie from an action standpoint. Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger is without a doubt the best villain the MCU has presented so far. His motivations are so clear and his ideology directly challenges T'Challa's. He is physically and psychologically the perfect adversary for Black Panther. Cons:
The pacing of the movie is a bit odd. It moves pretty quickly until everything comes to a head at the very end. More time should have been spent in between to flesh out the side characters and let the emotions sink in. In addition, the action scenes are not among Marvel's best. The last battle between Panther and Killmonger in particular is pretty disappointing in all honesty. The CGI felt unfinished and they could have been cut together better. Overall, Black Panther is a triumph for the MCU and its societal connotations. This is, in my opinion, the best origin movie that Marvel has made because of its amazing hero, great cast of role characters, and truly menacing villain. Black Panther gets an A."

","Marvel fantasy origin film. Based in 'Wakanda', which is an African fantasy location. The source of the population vast wealth, and advanced technology is an ancient cosmic metal called 'nonsenseanium' The plot is poor, the acting is wooden, with no humour and hardly any action. We see how the 'Lion King Simba' rip-off becomes king and is challenged by the 'Scar' rip-off for his throne. The film has been over-hyped and not as good as the reviews lead you to believe, it appears that reviews are being cautious of giving honest criticism in fear of being called racist!I didn't much like Wonder Woman either, but this isn't even as good as that.
Overly long (134 minutes), very disappointing and boring."

Most moviegoers such as myself take in a flick to escape today's overt political nonsense and everybody's got an agenda world we live in........even if only for a couple hours. Forget about it. Not going to happen. For me there is so much effort to preach (as that's what it is) a particular political viewpoint that it totally interferes with story and character development. Because of this I found Black Panther almost unbearable and struggled to make it to the end. Besides that, technically the CGI was wayyyy off and character development severely compromised. Just awful. Possibly the most undeservingly overhyped movie of all time."

Black people are the best race ever we get it, everyone is entitled to there own opinions, just don't push it on the viewers. I appreciate what was trying to be done but everything else is just drowned out by all the BS. And the really crappy character development and poor cgi that plagues the screen, along with all the comic book errors made throughout, like Erik gaining powers from consuming the heart shaped herb. Let me be very clear I absolutely love Chadwick Bozeman as the Black Panther in Civil War, i'm ashamed that not even his talents as an actor, could save this awful mess, and Andy Serkis was awesome as usual, a waste of potential. Overall it has decent moments here and there, but nothing new or relevant, not a good movie period."

I stayed with it to the bitter end but found little to make it unique among its Marvel brotherhood. If anything, it pulled in every cliche one could think of, having a black hero. Maybe the producers will learn from this and bring the guy back. By the way, it didn't deserve all those ""One"" ratings. There were some incredible scenes. It just didn't meld."

Massively over-hyped and over-praised, largely because of the racial angle. What you have is ultimately nothing new: the usual action and CGI-centric storyline, the basic, wafer-thin plot, the token character development, i.e. just another Avengers-type movie.This is not a revolutionary movie in terms of breaking stereotypes - if you're looking for that, watch In The Heat Of The Night (1967), or any one of several Sidney Poitier movies, instead."

The Wakanda society accepts the dispute for the kingdom between the outsider Erik Killmonger and T'Challa without any plebiscite. The villain defeats T'Challa is a fair fight as per the Rules. Then Tchalla´s mother, sister and girlfriend recover him using the powerful plant destined to Wakanda kings. And T'Challa returns to Wakanda in a coup d'état, destroying the aircrafts sent by Killmonger to the spies. W'Kabi and his army support Killmonger and in the end, it seems that everything is all right in Wakanda that seems to have a great division between the social classes. There is also excessive references to the ""birth of mankind"" in the view of the writer. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Pantera Negra"" (""Black Panther"")"

","I guess, because of the hype, I was expecting ""the best Marvel movie ever,"" or at least ""the best Marvel movie if the year.""I pray to God and Stan Lee that this isn't the best Marvel Movie of 2018.The fact is, there are maybe 3 laughs in the entire film. Three moments where you smile. Three moments where you crack a grin and they all come exclusively from Letitia Wright.And it wasn't because there were jokes and they didn't land. It was really because the movie took itself far too seriously. Like Winter Soldier and Civil War it had a message to tell...but unlike the Captain American movies, it thought its message was so serious that it couldn't laugh even at itself.I think, honestly, it even forgot it was a Marvel movie. In fact at time I think that the director, crew, and cast all thought that they were making ""Roots"" meets the new ""A Birth of a Nation""And Martin Freedman, yeah I think he was only there to prove that he could do a better American accent than his Sherlock counterpart. Maybe it was a bet, which part of the cast of Sherlock can hold an American accent throughout an entire film?And, honestly I am disappointed, because ALL three grins in the film went to Letitia Wright and Martin Freeman has some fairly decent comedic timing...they just didn't let it show. At least not for Freeman or ANYONE ELSE.Honestly, I'm surprised they even let Letitia Wright makes us smile or entertain us an any way.Honestly, it felt a lot like I was watching a college lecture...but a college lecture for a class that has a mandatory attendance policy and a professor that ONLY teaches from the book that he himself wrote...you get that kind of overly-serious pretentious feel to it.And...really, how often do people have to tell other people who they are in this movie? That really happened far too often and not in the ""Bond, James Bond"" way but in the ""If I tell you who I am it's going to give me extra power"" kind of way.And in the end you get two fight scenes by a waterfall that weren't very inspired and failed in comparison to other MCU fights. You get a car chase that was again...uninspired and fell flat but this time in the ""we've seen this before only done better"" kind of way. And a climatic battle that felt a little like the Gungan/Battle Droid battle in The Phantom Menace only with better CGI and an uninspired fight between the two powers rather than the Jedi dual.At least Winter Soldier and Civil War allowed us to laugh and relax a bit during the more serious MCU fair. At least they pulled out the stops when it came to action and, despite the message...tried to deliver something, anything.All this gave us was, well, a lecture and one where the action seemed, well, it seemed like the cast and crew felt they were obligated to give us that and thus did it with disdain.. It felt like all involved thought that entertainment would take away from the preaching.And really, have a message....just please entertain me. I work hard. I already went to school. What I want for the price of admission is to be entertained.If you can't do that, if you only let Letitia Wright make me smile and then only three times in a super hero movie that doesn't wow with action...then you've failed.In fact, you've failed so much that you aren't ""the first Black super-hero movie"" I'm taking that pilfered title and giving it back to Blade...because at least Blade was entertaining."

","First of all before anyone calls me racist on the other side of the screen I am a melinated person. I'm a huge MCU fan too. Black Panther outside of the movie is a cool badass character.Anyways this movie has a great story at the same time it is underwhelming. The acting and costumes were marvelous. Very traditional and technology feel.
But that does not mean it's automatically the best movie or a great movie. Visuals and ""panther"" power is not enough.The over hypeness made this movie look bad. It could have been more dramatic on so many levels. It could have been THE MOVIE but was not.The movie rushes to make Killmonger king who becomes king for less than a day. T'Challa is in a coma for less than a few hours. Then the movie just rushes to a fight and that's about it.This movie lacks drama, dialogue and development. The over hypeness from fans, media and band-wagoners is what kills this movie from being higher than a 5.I suppose Mcu fans and many black people were just ill during the time of the release to notice the flaws of this hash.This movie could be so much more but with the MCU formula we have to settle for subpar movies.Black Panther is one of the most overrated movies of all time . Black Panther isn't the first Black Superhero to make it to the big screen, get that through your head. So where was all this hype coming from? And Why?
Black Panther is not a good movie.I recommend this movie to the brainwashed.Verdict: The Pantah and T'challa are great characters. It's just this movie was hash."

","Wanted to see 'Black Panther' for a while, one of my most anticipated films of this early half of 2018 and as somebody who likes to loves most of Marvel's films. The idea was interesting as was what the film was hyped up to be, the trailer looked great and the high ratings and critical acclaim promised even more. My thoughts were that 'Black Panther' was a decent and intriguing film with a lot of very well done to great elements, but it didn't blow me away and left me disappointed after the hype. As indicated, far from hated it, didn't love it. Actually saw 'Black Panther' on opening weekend in a sold out showing (it was touch and go as to whether a ticket could be gotten), but had to properly form my thoughts for a while and was nervous seeing the very divisive IMDb reaction and the condescension on both sides (mostly negative), which has slightly died down since to feel less nervous.Starting with the good/great things, 'Black Panther' is mostly impressive visually. The special effects were variable, but there were some spectacular ones, while it's beautifully and stylishly shot, slickly edited and sumptuously costumed. It's the extraordinary production design that was most note-worthy. Loved the use of technology, which was really cool. The music has the right amount of haunting intensity, energy, dignity and pathos, so a fine score on its own but not always utilised right in the film, a few ill-fitting moments mood-wise.Much of the action is exciting, though there could have been more, and there is a good deal of thought-provoking script-writing with some nicely injected humour. One is immersed in the world of Wakanda, which is a fascinating world in thematic terms. The story does grip once it gets going and doesn't feel as confused and jumpy, with timeline and location changes needing to be clearer, like it did to begin with and a lot of it even when turning our everyday struggles on their heads is surprisingly relevant. Personally thought that much of the acting was good, with a very charismatic lead performance from Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan bringing a self-loathing conflicted edge and swagger to Killmonger and Andy Serkis relishing his role with aplomb. The women are just as good, with a dignified Lupita Nyong'o, regal, no-nonsense and feisty Danai Gurira and particularly a funny and endearing Letitia Wright. While his role is small, Daniel Kaluuya is great fun in it. Direction is above competent, if not innovative, and really appreciated the film making Killmonger more than the standard Marvel villain, here one with questionable personal motives but one where one can see his point of view and empathise. Although his actions are inconsistent and don't always make sense and he could have been more threatening, generally he is one of the better Marvel villains and the most developed character in a film too full of stock ones (the titular character being the other exception). 'Black Panther' has faults however. Most of the characters are stock and clichéd, while some of the first half is too talky, the film is a little slow-going and confused to start with and some of the political elements are laid on too thick. Adding to the general feel that, even with the splashes of humour, the film takes itself too seriously and with the amount of predictability it has doesn't do enough new with a novel concept. There are exceptions to the cast. Forrest Whittaker is wasted as a non-developed character with too short screen time, on top of the scene being rushed his final scene has no impact as a result. Martin Freeman is too fish out of water as well. Although some of the effects are spectacular, others are very ropy. Especially in the final action scene between Black Panther and Killmonger which resembled a very early days/years video game. That scene also felt rushed, sometimes vaguely choreographed and anti-climactic, though the whole climax felt over-stuffed and too busy. Overall, decent and interesting but was expecting more. Personally don't think it's the best Marvel film, while a long way from bad let alone terrible, for me it's one of the weaker ones. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
" Most overrated MCU movie and extremely generic

1/10
","I managed to see this movie again during the weekend, preparing for Captain Marvel, and I felt I had to do a review on this movie. Especially since Cap was such a great movie in comparison.Black Panther is not only the most overrated MCU movie so far, I would go so far as to say it is one of the most overrated movies of all time.
It is not horrible bad per se, it is just so darn boring.
The reason it is so boring is partly because it is super generic - bad guy wants hero´s stuff/title, bad guy fights good guy and ""wins"", good guy comes back reinforced/trained/equipped or with allies and wins in the end. That is it. That is the movie. Which would be fine-ish if the movie had something else to offer, but except for clothing and music, it does not.
The second reason this movie is so boring is because there is no excitment - the movie is so predictable that after 10min I could tell you exactly what would happen. Well, I did not know that the villain, who is the most Hitleresque character I have seen in a movie, had ancestors jumping into the sea dying because they wanted to be free. He was Wakandan, no slaves there.. so what was he talking about?But yes, lets talk villains. Claw was great for the time he was in the movie, and the Rhino dude had decent motivation so okay I will buy that. But the main villain of the story want to spread weapons, conquer, and save people that ""look like him"". All in a nationalistic very neo-fascist fashion. Almost all of his speaches mimic Hitler, if you do not believe me, check out a clip of Hitler and compare. Uncanny likeness. And this is a villain so many can relate to? Weird.Something else that stod out was the bad CGi, what happen Marvel? Why suddenly so bad computer graphics? The two CGi suits fighting in the end took me so far out of the movie that I starting to think of what to eat for lunch the day after.And finally this is the most political Marvel movie to date. In some aspects I both expected it and can think it is necessary - it is very hard to talk Africa in this context and not mention slavery. HOWEVER, In the MCU, Wakanda is located just north of Lake Turkana, at a point bordering Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, and South Sudan. Do you know who took slaves there historically? It was not white men, nor christians... so... why was that not mention?
And the wall thingie at the end, was that really necessary? Felt out of place, out of character, and too much on the nose.I give this a 3/10, and I think Black Panther is the second or third worst Marvel movie so far. As part of that universe it should perhaps not be overlooked by fans, but otherwise I cannot recommend this at all. So, so boring movie. Even The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, all of the Thor movies, hell even Justice League, was more fun then this. Not bad, just bland, boring, predictable, extremely generic, and did I mention boring?"
" Disappointing

","This was supposed to be the newest and best Marvel movie. It was also supposed to be deeper than a super hero movie. Well, basically all they did was put African-Americans in the role of the main characters and followed the same exact formula of every other Marvel movie ever created. The action was mediocre at best. The villain was good, but at the point when he truly started to flesh out his character, I was bored and realized I was watching a movie. I literally said what was going to happen about 30 minutes before it happened. Now if you like super hero films, which I happen to not but if you do I am sure you will have fun and enjoy this film. But, in my opinion this movie had th intensity of a haircut and was a boring commercial to sell toys."

I feel the story would have been better told had there been another villain. The acting also seemed either way too overboard for some of the characters, while others under-performed.Nevertheless, enjoyable, but certainly not even close to ""the best"" Marvel movie.

","With all the hype surrounding this movie (excellent trailers, Kendrick-curated soundtrack, all-African cast) I thought I was in for something special with Black Panther, as while they aren't remotely the highest quality movies, the Marvel cinematic universe movies are generally pretty entertaining. As it turns out I was wrong, Black Panther was extremely average, I have no idea what these critics/review bots are talking about when they say that it is the best Marvel movie and worthy of ""critical"" praise (as not just a super hero movie but as a movie in general.)Things that I liked:
Effort put into aesthetic authenticity of the African elements of the movie - within the Marvel universe the look and feel of the movie was unique and you can tell care was taken in this regard.Andy Serkis - My favorite character by far, was probably the only person who didnt seem like he was reading from a script sheet and got some genuine laughs out of me.Things that I didn't like:
The story was extremely predictable and to be honest I don't know if the most virtuous resolution was reached in the climax. Michael B Jordan's character had fairly reasonable intentions for wanting to kill the Black Panther and take his place in Wakanda as he had been abandoned, with seemingly no family, to live in the ghettos of Oakland. However, his whole plan to give advanced Wakandan weaponry to every African person in the world so they could kill and overthrow people in power who weren't African was extremely ""on-the-chin"" in terms of its narrative motivations within the current climate. It wasn't remotely clever or nuanced and really unbalanced his character, his motivations were understandable but his plan was moronic. Additionally, who didn't see Black Panther surviving his fall? Who didn't see the Gorilla tribe coming to the rescue at the end? The entire movie was so bland and predictable I wanted it to be over well before the end - I didn't even stay for the post credit scenes...The acting was very wooden - Not a lot to say here really, some really poor line delivery from the cast across the board except for Andy Serkis. No one was particularly charismatic, the main character for instance was extremely boring.The script was very robotic - This ties into the poor acting, but perhaps as a result of the script, some of the actors never really had a chance to bring their characters to life.The characters - I have already addressed the mess that was Michael B Jordan's character Warmonger(?). Basically throughout the entire movie you never really learn anything or see anything of the Black Panther's character, he basically moves from one place to another showing no emotion and just either smashes things or asks people questions. Apparently the character is supposed to be very intelligent, while it was probably a narrative choice, the Black Panther in this movie seemed like an emotionless Jarhead whose only really characteristic was that he get nervous around his girlfriend... The women in this movie had a bit of attitude and charisma and shouldn't be blanketed down with the Black Panther and Warmonger as bad characters, but they didnt really get a chance to shine and really only contributed a few one liners and a bit of fighting.The action - Shaky-cam rubbish, the action in the movie is terrible and not remotely on the level of the well-choreographed fighting in say Captain America Winter Soldier - please for the love of god show someone getting punched or kicked without having to cut the shot 5 times. There is an action sequence at the start which basically flagposted what the action was going to be like, it is shot at night and you basically cant see bloody anything...The CGI - Honestly, the CGI in Black Panther felt extrmely overused and was surprisingly quite bad. It really took me out of some scenes because the environments and effects looked average (not quite Justice League bad but not far off). It is obvious in scenes in Wakanda, for instance, where the plains/mountains are in the background but they are clearly filming in front of a green screen. Some of the effects just looked silly and got laughs out of me and my party. I personally though the Rhinos were stupid...The Soundtrack - After all the hype surrounding Kendrick Lamar curating a soundtrack for the movie, the tracks from that album barely feature at all. They faintly play from some cars and stuff here and there and a couple feature in some action scenes but I though we would be watching some decent action scenes with some bass heavy Kendrick blasting along to the fighting. Alas, no dice. The orchestral score is also quite average, coming in strong at weird moments and being quite out of place in certain places, there are a couple of moments where it seems like some sort of fairy, Harry Potter, Narnia music that just doesn't fit the scene.Overall I think this is probably one of the weaker Marvel movies, avoiding honest criticism because of the hype surrounding it. The basic components of the film are all poor-average, with the only real 5+/10 aspect being the aesthetics of Wakanda and its people. Like I said above, I wanted to leave well before it was over because I knew the action was probably not going to improve from nauseating shaky-cam and I knew how it was all going to play out."

","First, this movie has a lot of pointless scenes that achieve nothing, the museum scene with pointless covert operation ending up in killing everyone anyway, that's so not Silent Assassin. The 007 Bond casino scene was just there to establish the most worthless character in movie history - Everett K. Ross. After the capture of Klaue (surprisingly surviving a horrible car crash), we get another pointless scene where Killmonger and his girlfriend re-capture Klaue just to kill him again for no reason. Killmonger never actually needed Klaue in the first place, so killing him was as pointless as freeing him out. Killmonger also kills his GF for no particular reason yet again. He could've easily get to Wakanda anyway since he has the royal tattoo (they also gave those to vampire servants in Blade). Then Killmonger and Black Panther participate in previously established variety of local Mak'Gora (election process I guess). Black Panther fails miserably and the new stronger king takes the throne, the end, right? No. They actually want you to root for the most useless and impotent king ever. Killmonger then says something stupid about colonization and oppression, and decides to use the Vibranium weapons (produced solely by a 16 y.o. girl mastermind) to conquer the world. So he's like pro-anti-colonization or something, you tell me. Yet he is betrayed by his people (Okoye literally says she will stay loyal to the king and in 5 minutes betrays the new king) and they all happily participate in a civil war slaughter until Killmonger gets killed. Also love how they intercepted their own ships with their own people, just murdering them. There was also some sort of brother betrayal, but it was so shallow and lacking motivation that it isn't really worth discussing. The brother (I think) wanted to have some more action and so he betrayed the king just to lower his weapons and suffer a life sentence afterwards. After slaughtering his own people, everything gets back to normal. And the king who solves all problems with violence decides to share his tech and knowledge to help the world. But not like the whole world, mostly African-american people in the US. I'm sure it's going to be pretty easy, since all technology in this world is done by one genius girl.Then we get the first post-credit scene when BP visits the UN assembly and says that he is ready to share the knowledge with all the nations. I'm pretty sure that we already have a lot of knowledge on slaughtering each other in wars and even civil wars, so his knowledge is not going to make a great difference.Summing it up, we get a weak impotent king to hold his throne. He never cared about anyone besides himself really, the fact that he suggests to heal Killmonger who killed Zuri just for lulz shows that he doesn't care. He never cares about his own people since he never hesitated on killing them personally. Just a little advice, if you wan't to have a good king character, ask Llane Wrynn how to rule.Killmonger was driven by revenge at first, then his motivation turned into some uncertain political position about oppression, but in the end it seems that he just loved his country (but not the people, it seems). The scene where BP suggests that Killmonger can be saved and healed completely destroys all the rivalry and the motivation of both. Anyway, Killmonger and Klaue were the best characters in the movie. The story was nonsense, they achieved nothing , BP leaned nothing and is still a worthless king and a bad leader. Was nice to see Serkis having a lot of fun in this movie, I love that guy and I'd love to see more of him (guess he's tired of playing CGI puppets...Gollum...Gollum).I also loved all the wishful thinking in this movie, which is mostly based on the comic I guess. Advanced native African people with space technology saving the world? Any educated person would suggest you checking South Africa after 1994. Supporting the immigrants in the US? Come on, guys...The good stuff: even though there were just 3 sets of Wakanda I still kinda loved it, the music choice was good, showing all that traditionalism, the nature. Killmonger's scene with his father was gold, I wish we had more dramatic scenes (it was well acted and well executed overall). The sister was kinda cool sometimes, being a more modern character and rejecting the old ways. Even though she's a little too much Mary Sue.Yet the main reason why I still decided to write this is the reviews. This has to stop. And I'm not talking solely about RT 97% which is just ridiculous. It's like people are afraid to judge something impartially cause of getting shamed for being racist or something. Also, this movie started with fair 7.1 on IMDB later to be loaded with >30% of 10 ratings eventually ending up in 7.9 (as of now, I'm sure it will only go up). I'm not saying that IMDB has something to do with this, but this rating surely does not reflect the quality of the movie.Conclusion: don't trust ratings (nor RT or IMDB). If you like it - like it, if you don't - no need to be afraid to say that you didn't like it.You know you've seen a good movie when you exit the theater with something changed inside, an emotion, a thought - BP is not such a movie."

","Chadwick Boseman who played a pair of real live black icons and played them
well makes a reappearance as T'Changa whom we met in Captain American
Civil War. Jackie Robinson and Thurgood Marshall should only have had the
superpowers this guy has. Including a mysterious mineral that gives those who use it some real staying power. Kind of like kryptonite.With technological advances we can sure do more with these superheroes than
could have been done in Hollywood's golden era. But I think the real reason
these films are so popular is that real life isn't providing us with that many
heroes to admire. Sure easier to root for Marvel Comics creation.Anyway Boseman's father died and being the crown prince he's the logical
successor. But in the hidden kingdom of Wakanda you can get challenged.
Something like the way the Klingons choose their leader. Boseman defeats
one challenger, but another one, an exile raised in the mean streets of Oakland played by Michael B. Jordan emerges and he takes over for a bit.
Boseman is down, but not out.Kids and Trekkie types will certainly love this. Not my particular cup of tea,
but it's nicely done and packaged.The only question I have is that if these Wakandans are as powerful as they
are, why weren't the first Arab slave traders repelled let alone European buyers? Seems like that was the time to make their presence known."

","With all the hype surrounding this movie, I must admit that I had expected something extraordinary.However the ""Black Panther"" movie was not all as outstanding as it was cranked up to be. Don't get me wrong here, because I am not saying the movie is bad. Far from it as it was still rather enjoyable. It just wasn't outstanding amidst the many Marvel movies that flood the movie market.The storyline in ""Black Panther"" was adequate, albeit somewhat generic and predictable.The acting in the movie was good and they really had gotten together a great ensemble of actors and actresses to perform in the movie. Personally, then I was most impressed with Andy Serkis, and it was quite nice to see him in person and not doing blue-suit performances.The action was fast paced and well-choreographed, which definitely added to the overall enjoyment of the movie.This being a Marvel superhero movie, of course you expect a grand visual presentation of CGI. And let me just say that the CGI in the movie were great, as they always are in these Marvel superhero movies.All in all, an entertaining enough movie. Although not among the top of superhero movies for me."

","Having seen the overwhelming critic reviews and overall success and accolades that this film has received, the hype for this Black Panther film was at a height that rarely many superhero films (even films of any genre)have amassed.This film is visually stunning, with great direction, and overall acting. Likable rooting characters but in general, there was a lack of interest. The story line felt as if we have seen before. The plot isn't quite as refreshing or unique as originally thought, and at times was somewhat boring.We can see as to how and why many people have considered this film to be overrated and not nearly as great as its critics are founding over. Perhaps this is one of those films where we need to have interest in the culture and overall character landmark to fully feel connected. In the end, one was left disappointed."

In general, this movie is fine, as I have stated earlier, but the truth is that the professional critics have judge this movie for the wrong reasons, they have let their political interests overshadow their ability to rate a movie the way it's supposed to be.In conclusion, this movie is completely overrated, also, definitely not the best movie of the year, not even in the top ten, not even the best movie of superheroes of this year and even though the academy nominated it for best picture it is still overrated. If you want to watch a really good superheroe movie and a really good movie in general I suggest The Dark Knight not Black panther."

","This is my second attempt to review this title. 
I was able to see a screening of this in Europe...waste of time. Predictable and laughable at points, it desperately tries to keep pace with other Marvel offerings but fails miserably. The storyline begins with an extremely promising origin for the characters but instead of capitalizing on this and building on it we move to forced action sequences that are poorly done (horrible CGI). That's where the attempt to keep pace with other Marvel and DC offerings becomes obvious...cliché phrases and over the top reaches to create new ones. Some borrowing from previous Marvel ""technology"" really tried to claim it to it's own, but was sadly obvious. Jordan did an outstanding job portraying Erik Killmonger and Whitaker was great, as always...the rest of the cast fell miles short of bringing these characters to life. It's okay to act with a chip on your shoulder because THAT'S what make hero characters pop...BUT you must act first. As the Marvel scene is beginning to become over saturated, this film at least allows us to take a break from an actual Marvel film.Not good enough to call ""cookie cutter""..."

","Academy award nominee for best picture? All I can say is, if this is the best example of an action film that has been produced that is actually worthy of a nomination for best picture than this has to be one of the worst years (2018) ever in the history of the film making industry. I mean, as far as a Marvel action film goes, this is definitely above average. The generally anticipated saturation of CGI (Computer Graphics Interface) technology was actually bearable, but the fight scenes were dragged out far too long.Try and imagine a John Wayne western fight being dragged out for as long as the last fight in this movie was which takes place between cousins T'Challa / Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and the super buff and shirtless Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan). John Wayne enjoyed a long and illustrious career in many film genres and one of the ways he accomplished that was by making sure none of his fight scenes dragged on too long. So a little advice for my bro's Chadwick and Michael B. ""ya gotta no when to hold 'em, and know when to fold 'em"".Mrs. Shullivan and I liked that the women warriors were all strong, black and beautiful women with a head on their shoulders and did not bend for any man, King or no King. The power struggle to mainatin the rare earth minerals, the civil war between the five (5) tribes, and the earlier scene where the young girls were being treated like cargo vaguely reminds us about what has transpired on the African continent over the past century. But kids won't get it, and adults want to see positive reinforcements without weaponizing the tribes.It's a decent enough Marvel film, but I don't think it will be on my ""repeat"" list to watch anytime soon. I give the film a 6 out of 10 rating. Please don't disappoint us with any further bad choice Academy Award winners."

The narrative is promising at the outset, but fails miserably as it deteriorates into the absurd, and then continues to drip like Chinese water torture from the poorly written screenplay.

The entire production was a laughable exercise in nonsense, and the CGI was worse."

8/10
","Black Panther, directed by Ryan Coogler, tells the story of the new King T'Challa of Wakanda who must learn to handle the responsibilities of this title. Chadwick Boseman reprises his role as the Black Panther and goes up against his nemesis Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan.Pros:
Coogler has already proven himself to be an excellent director after movies like Fruitvale Station and Creed (both starring Jordan), but he showcases his full talents in Black Panther when given a huge budget to work with. The movie looks beautiful with bright lush colors. The soundtrack and musical score are also very good. At its heart, the movie's message is very profound and relevant to real world politics.As expected, Boseman is awesome as T'Challa. His character goes through so much and his development throughout is handled perfectly. The best scenes of this movie are when he has to look within himself to find answers when the people he always trusted let him down. The cast in general has very good chemistry. T'Challa's relationship with his sister Shuri (Letiitia Wright) is very funny and it's easy to buy them as siblings. His relationship with his love Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) is even better. It would be criminal not to mention Danai Gurira and what she gives this movie from an action standpoint. Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger is without a doubt the best villain the MCU has presented so far. His motivations are so clear and his ideology directly challenges T'Challa's. He is physically and psychologically the perfect adversary for Black Panther. Cons:
The pacing of the movie is a bit odd. It moves pretty quickly until everything comes to a head at the very end. More time should have been spent in between to flesh out the side characters and let the emotions sink in. In addition, the action scenes are not among Marvel's best. The last battle between Panther and Killmonger in particular is pretty disappointing in all honesty. The CGI felt unfinished and they could have been cut together better. Overall, Black Panther is a triumph for the MCU and its societal connotations. This is, in my opinion, the best origin movie that Marvel has made because of its amazing hero, great cast of role characters, and truly menacing villain. Black Panther gets an A."

","Marvel fantasy origin film. Based in 'Wakanda', which is an African fantasy location. The source of the population vast wealth, and advanced technology is an ancient cosmic metal called 'nonsenseanium' The plot is poor, the acting is wooden, with no humour and hardly any action. We see how the 'Lion King Simba' rip-off becomes king and is challenged by the 'Scar' rip-off for his throne. The film has been over-hyped and not as good as the reviews lead you to believe, it appears that reviews are being cautious of giving honest criticism in fear of being called racist!I didn't much like Wonder Woman either, but this isn't even as good as that.
Overly long (134 minutes), very disappointing and boring."

Most moviegoers such as myself take in a flick to escape today's overt political nonsense and everybody's got an agenda world we live in........even if only for a couple hours. Forget about it. Not going to happen. For me there is so much effort to preach (as that's what it is) a particular political viewpoint that it totally interferes with story and character development. Because of this I found Black Panther almost unbearable and struggled to make it to the end. Besides that, technically the CGI was wayyyy off and character development severely compromised. Just awful. Possibly the most undeservingly overhyped movie of all time."

Black people are the best race ever we get it, everyone is entitled to there own opinions, just don't push it on the viewers. I appreciate what was trying to be done but everything else is just drowned out by all the BS. And the really crappy character development and poor cgi that plagues the screen, along with all the comic book errors made throughout, like Erik gaining powers from consuming the heart shaped herb. Let me be very clear I absolutely love Chadwick Bozeman as the Black Panther in Civil War, i'm ashamed that not even his talents as an actor, could save this awful mess, and Andy Serkis was awesome as usual, a waste of potential. Overall it has decent moments here and there, but nothing new or relevant, not a good movie period."

I stayed with it to the bitter end but found little to make it unique among its Marvel brotherhood. If anything, it pulled in every cliche one could think of, having a black hero. Maybe the producers will learn from this and bring the guy back. By the way, it didn't deserve all those ""One"" ratings. There were some incredible scenes. It just didn't meld."

It's interesting, but all of the critics seemed to rave about it.I want to give huge credit to Chadwick Boseman though, he was great here, what a brave man, RIP.3/10."

Massively over-hyped and over-praised, largely because of the racial angle. What you have is ultimately nothing new: the usual action and CGI-centric storyline, the basic, wafer-thin plot, the token character development, i.e. just another Avengers-type movie.This is not a revolutionary movie in terms of breaking stereotypes - if you're looking for that, watch In The Heat Of The Night (1967), or any one of several Sidney Poitier movies, instead."

Then Tchalla´s mother, sister and girlfriend recover him using the powerful plant destined to Wakanda kings. And T'Challa returns to Wakanda in a coup d'état, destroying the aircrafts sent by Killmonger to the spies. W'Kabi and his army support Killmonger and in the end, it seems that everything is all right in Wakanda that seems to have a great division between the social classes. There is also excessive references to the ""birth of mankind"" in the view of the writer. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Pantera Negra"" (""Black Panther"")"

","I guess, because of the hype, I was expecting ""the best Marvel movie ever,"" or at least ""the best Marvel movie if the year.""I pray to God and Stan Lee that this isn't the best Marvel Movie of 2018.The fact is, there are maybe 3 laughs in the entire film. Three moments where you smile. Three moments where you crack a grin and they all come exclusively from Letitia Wright.And it wasn't because there were jokes and they didn't land. It was really because the movie took itself far too seriously. Like Winter Soldier and Civil War it had a message to tell...but unlike the Captain American movies, it thought its message was so serious that it couldn't laugh even at itself.I think, honestly, it even forgot it was a Marvel movie. In fact at time I think that the director, crew, and cast all thought that they were making ""Roots"" meets the new ""A Birth of a Nation""And Martin Freedman, yeah I think he was only there to prove that he could do a better American accent than his Sherlock counterpart. Maybe it was a bet, which part of the cast of Sherlock can hold an American accent throughout an entire film?And, honestly I am disappointed, because ALL three grins in the film went to Letitia Wright and Martin Freeman has some fairly decent comedic timing...they just didn't let it show. At least not for Freeman or ANYONE ELSE.Honestly, I'm surprised they even let Letitia Wright makes us smile or entertain us an any way.Honestly, it felt a lot like I was watching a college lecture...but a college lecture for a class that has a mandatory attendance policy and a professor that ONLY teaches from the book that he himself wrote...you get that kind of overly-serious pretentious feel to it.And...really, how often do people have to tell other people who they are in this movie? That really happened far too often and not in the ""Bond, James Bond"" way but in the ""If I tell you who I am it's going to give me extra power"" kind of way.And in the end you get two fight scenes by a waterfall that weren't very inspired and failed in comparison to other MCU fights. You get a car chase that was again...uninspired and fell flat but this time in the ""we've seen this before only done better"" kind of way. And a climatic battle that felt a little like the Gungan/Battle Droid battle in The Phantom Menace only with better CGI and an uninspired fight between the two powers rather than the Jedi dual.At least Winter Soldier and Civil War allowed us to laugh and relax a bit during the more serious MCU fair. At least they pulled out the stops when it came to action and, despite the message...tried to deliver something, anything.All this gave us was, well, a lecture and one where the action seemed, well, it seemed like the cast and crew felt they were obligated to give us that and thus did it with disdain.. It felt like all involved thought that entertainment would take away from the preaching.And really, have a message....just please entertain me. I work hard. I already went to school. What I want for the price of admission is to be entertained.If you can't do that, if you only let Letitia Wright make me smile and then only three times in a super hero movie that doesn't wow with action...then you've failed.In fact, you've failed so much that you aren't ""the first Black super-hero movie"" I'm taking that pilfered title and giving it back to Blade...because at least Blade was entertaining."

","First of all before anyone calls me racist on the other side of the screen I am a melinated person. I'm a huge MCU fan too. Black Panther outside of the movie is a cool badass character.Anyways this movie has a great story at the same time it is underwhelming. The acting and costumes were marvelous. Very traditional and technology feel.
But that does not mean it's automatically the best movie or a great movie. Visuals and ""panther"" power is not enough.The over hypeness made this movie look bad. It could have been more dramatic on so many levels. It could have been THE MOVIE but was not.The movie rushes to make Killmonger king who becomes king for less than a day. T'Challa is in a coma for less than a few hours. Then the movie just rushes to a fight and that's about it.This movie lacks drama, dialogue and development. The over hypeness from fans, media and band-wagoners is what kills this movie from being higher than a 5.I suppose Mcu fans and many black people were just ill during the time of the release to notice the flaws of this hash.This movie could be so much more but with the MCU formula we have to settle for subpar movies.Black Panther is one of the most overrated movies of all time . Black Panther isn't the first Black Superhero to make it to the big screen, get that through your head. So where was all this hype coming from? And Why?
Black Panther is not a good movie.I recommend this movie to the brainwashed.Verdict: The Pantah and T'challa are great characters. It's just this movie was hash."

","Wanted to see 'Black Panther' for a while, one of my most anticipated films of this early half of 2018 and as somebody who likes to loves most of Marvel's films. The idea was interesting as was what the film was hyped up to be, the trailer looked great and the high ratings and critical acclaim promised even more. My thoughts were that 'Black Panther' was a decent and intriguing film with a lot of very well done to great elements, but it didn't blow me away and left me disappointed after the hype. As indicated, far from hated it, didn't love it. Actually saw 'Black Panther' on opening weekend in a sold out showing (it was touch and go as to whether a ticket could be gotten), but had to properly form my thoughts for a while and was nervous seeing the very divisive IMDb reaction and the condescension on both sides (mostly negative), which has slightly died down since to feel less nervous.Starting with the good/great things, 'Black Panther' is mostly impressive visually. The special effects were variable, but there were some spectacular ones, while it's beautifully and stylishly shot, slickly edited and sumptuously costumed. It's the extraordinary production design that was most note-worthy. Loved the use of technology, which was really cool. The music has the right amount of haunting intensity, energy, dignity and pathos, so a fine score on its own but not always utilised right in the film, a few ill-fitting moments mood-wise.Much of the action is exciting, though there could have been more, and there is a good deal of thought-provoking script-writing with some nicely injected humour. One is immersed in the world of Wakanda, which is a fascinating world in thematic terms. The story does grip once it gets going and doesn't feel as confused and jumpy, with timeline and location changes needing to be clearer, like it did to begin with and a lot of it even when turning our everyday struggles on their heads is surprisingly relevant. Personally thought that much of the acting was good, with a very charismatic lead performance from Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan bringing a self-loathing conflicted edge and swagger to Killmonger and Andy Serkis relishing his role with aplomb. The women are just as good, with a dignified Lupita Nyong'o, regal, no-nonsense and feisty Danai Gurira and particularly a funny and endearing Letitia Wright. While his role is small, Daniel Kaluuya is great fun in it. Direction is above competent, if not innovative, and really appreciated the film making Killmonger more than the standard Marvel villain, here one with questionable personal motives but one where one can see his point of view and empathise. Although his actions are inconsistent and don't always make sense and he could have been more threatening, generally he is one of the better Marvel villains and the most developed character in a film too full of stock ones (the titular character being the other exception). 'Black Panther' has faults however. Most of the characters are stock and clichéd, while some of the first half is too talky, the film is a little slow-going and confused to start with and some of the political elements are laid on too thick. Adding to the general feel that, even with the splashes of humour, the film takes itself too seriously and with the amount of predictability it has doesn't do enough new with a novel concept. There are exceptions to the cast. Forrest Whittaker is wasted as a non-developed character with too short screen time, on top of the scene being rushed his final scene has no impact as a result. Martin Freeman is too fish out of water as well. Although some of the effects are spectacular, others are very ropy. Especially in the final action scene between Black Panther and Killmonger which resembled a very early days/years video game. That scene also felt rushed, sometimes vaguely choreographed and anti-climactic, though the whole climax felt over-stuffed and too busy. Overall, decent and interesting but was expecting more. Personally don't think it's the best Marvel film, while a long way from bad let alone terrible, for me it's one of the weaker ones. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

Especially since Cap was such a great movie in comparison.Black Panther is not only the most overrated MCU movie so far, I would go so far as to say it is one of the most overrated movies of all time.
It is not horrible bad per se, it is just so darn boring.
The reason it is so boring is partly because it is super generic - bad guy wants hero´s stuff/title, bad guy fights good guy and ""wins"", good guy comes back reinforced/trained/equipped or with allies and wins in the end. That is it. That is the movie. Which would be fine-ish if the movie had something else to offer, but except for clothing and music, it does not.
The second reason this movie is so boring is because there is no excitment - the movie is so predictable that after 10min I could tell you exactly what would happen. Well, I did not know that the villain, who is the most Hitleresque character I have seen in a movie, had ancestors jumping into the sea dying because they wanted to be free. He was Wakandan, no slaves there.. so what was he talking about?But yes, lets talk villains. Claw was great for the time he was in the movie, and the Rhino dude had decent motivation so okay I will buy that. But the main villain of the story want to spread weapons, conquer, and save people that ""look like him"". All in a nationalistic very neo-fascist fashion. Almost all of his speaches mimic Hitler, if you do not believe me, check out a clip of Hitler and compare. Uncanny likeness. And this is a villain so many can relate to? Weird.Something else that stod out was the bad CGi, what happen Marvel? Why suddenly so bad computer graphics? The two CGi suits fighting in the end took me so far out of the movie that I starting to think of what to eat for lunch the day after.And finally this is the most political Marvel movie to date. In some aspects I both expected it and can think it is necessary - it is very hard to talk Africa in this context and not mention slavery. HOWEVER, In the MCU, Wakanda is located just north of Lake Turkana, at a point bordering Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, and South Sudan. Do you know who took slaves there historically? It was not white men, nor christians... so... why was that not mention?
And the wall thingie at the end, was that really necessary? Felt out of place, out of character, and too much on the nose.I give this a 3/10, and I think Black Panther is the second or third worst Marvel movie so far. As part of that universe it should perhaps not be overlooked by fans, but otherwise I cannot recommend this at all. So, so boring movie. Even The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, all of the Thor movies, hell even Justice League, was more fun then this. Not bad, just bland, boring, predictable, extremely generic, and did I mention boring?"

","This was supposed to be the newest and best Marvel movie. It was also supposed to be deeper than a super hero movie. Well, basically all they did was put African-Americans in the role of the main characters and followed the same exact formula of every other Marvel movie ever created. The action was mediocre at best. The villain was good, but at the point when he truly started to flesh out his character, I was bored and realized I was watching a movie. I literally said what was going to happen about 30 minutes before it happened. Now if you like super hero films, which I happen to not but if you do I am sure you will have fun and enjoy this film. But, in my opinion this movie had th intensity of a haircut and was a boring commercial to sell toys."

","The cinematography of this film was just OK with some obvious bad CGI, and one would come to expect something better from a Marvel superhero film (as shown by the budget). The directing was fairly decent.The story was ok, but nothing overly exciting. Way too much spotlight on the Black Panther conflict here. I feel the story would have been better told had there been another villain. The acting also seemed either way too overboard for some of the characters, while others under-performed.Nevertheless, enjoyable, but certainly not even close to ""the best"" Marvel movie. It's only a 6/10 from me."

1/10
","With all the hype surrounding this movie (excellent trailers, Kendrick-curated soundtrack, all-African cast) I thought I was in for something special with Black Panther, as while they aren't remotely the highest quality movies, the Marvel cinematic universe movies are generally pretty entertaining. As it turns out I was wrong, Black Panther was extremely average, I have no idea what these critics/review bots are talking about when they say that it is the best Marvel movie and worthy of ""critical"" praise (as not just a super hero movie but as a movie in general.)Things that I liked:
Effort put into aesthetic authenticity of the African elements of the movie - within the Marvel universe the look and feel of the movie was unique and you can tell care was taken in this regard.Andy Serkis - My favorite character by far, was probably the only person who didnt seem like he was reading from a script sheet and got some genuine laughs out of me.Things that I didn't like:
The story was extremely predictable and to be honest I don't know if the most virtuous resolution was reached in the climax. Michael B Jordan's character had fairly reasonable intentions for wanting to kill the Black Panther and take his place in Wakanda as he had been abandoned, with seemingly no family, to live in the ghettos of Oakland. However, his whole plan to give advanced Wakandan weaponry to every African person in the world so they could kill and overthrow people in power who weren't African was extremely ""on-the-chin"" in terms of its narrative motivations within the current climate. It wasn't remotely clever or nuanced and really unbalanced his character, his motivations were understandable but his plan was moronic. Additionally, who didn't see Black Panther surviving his fall? Who didn't see the Gorilla tribe coming to the rescue at the end? The entire movie was so bland and predictable I wanted it to be over well before the end - I didn't even stay for the post credit scenes...The acting was very wooden - Not a lot to say here really, some really poor line delivery from the cast across the board except for Andy Serkis. No one was particularly charismatic, the main character for instance was extremely boring.The script was very robotic - This ties into the poor acting, but perhaps as a result of the script, some of the actors never really had a chance to bring their characters to life.The characters - I have already addressed the mess that was Michael B Jordan's character Warmonger(?). Basically throughout the entire movie you never really learn anything or see anything of the Black Panther's character, he basically moves from one place to another showing no emotion and just either smashes things or asks people questions. Apparently the character is supposed to be very intelligent, while it was probably a narrative choice, the Black Panther in this movie seemed like an emotionless Jarhead whose only really characteristic was that he get nervous around his girlfriend... The women in this movie had a bit of attitude and charisma and shouldn't be blanketed down with the Black Panther and Warmonger as bad characters, but they didnt really get a chance to shine and really only contributed a few one liners and a bit of fighting.The action - Shaky-cam rubbish, the action in the movie is terrible and not remotely on the level of the well-choreographed fighting in say Captain America Winter Soldier - please for the love of god show someone getting punched or kicked without having to cut the shot 5 times. There is an action sequence at the start which basically flagposted what the action was going to be like, it is shot at night and you basically cant see bloody anything...The CGI - Honestly, the CGI in Black Panther felt extrmely overused and was surprisingly quite bad. It really took me out of some scenes because the environments and effects looked average (not quite Justice League bad but not far off). It is obvious in scenes in Wakanda, for instance, where the plains/mountains are in the background but they are clearly filming in front of a green screen. Some of the effects just looked silly and got laughs out of me and my party. I personally though the Rhinos were stupid...The Soundtrack - After all the hype surrounding Kendrick Lamar curating a soundtrack for the movie, the tracks from that album barely feature at all. They faintly play from some cars and stuff here and there and a couple feature in some action scenes but I though we would be watching some decent action scenes with some bass heavy Kendrick blasting along to the fighting. Alas, no dice. The orchestral score is also quite average, coming in strong at weird moments and being quite out of place in certain places, there are a couple of moments where it seems like some sort of fairy, Harry Potter, Narnia music that just doesn't fit the scene.Overall I think this is probably one of the weaker Marvel movies, avoiding honest criticism because of the hype surrounding it. The basic components of the film are all poor-average, with the only real 5+/10 aspect being the aesthetics of Wakanda and its people. Like I said above, I wanted to leave well before it was over because I knew the action was probably not going to improve from nauseating shaky-cam and I knew how it was all going to play out."
" Wishful thinking / Broken ratings / Longread

6/10
","First, this movie has a lot of pointless scenes that achieve nothing, the museum scene with pointless covert operation ending up in killing everyone anyway, that's so not Silent Assassin. The 007 Bond casino scene was just there to establish the most worthless character in movie history - Everett K. Ross. After the capture of Klaue (surprisingly surviving a horrible car crash), we get another pointless scene where Killmonger and his girlfriend re-capture Klaue just to kill him again for no reason. Killmonger never actually needed Klaue in the first place, so killing him was as pointless as freeing him out. Killmonger also kills his GF for no particular reason yet again. He could've easily get to Wakanda anyway since he has the royal tattoo (they also gave those to vampire servants in Blade). Then Killmonger and Black Panther participate in previously established variety of local Mak'Gora (election process I guess). Black Panther fails miserably and the new stronger king takes the throne, the end, right? No. They actually want you to root for the most useless and impotent king ever. Killmonger then says something stupid about colonization and oppression, and decides to use the Vibranium weapons (produced solely by a 16 y.o. girl mastermind) to conquer the world. So he's like pro-anti-colonization or something, you tell me. Yet he is betrayed by his people (Okoye literally says she will stay loyal to the king and in 5 minutes betrays the new king) and they all happily participate in a civil war slaughter until Killmonger gets killed. Also love how they intercepted their own ships with their own people, just murdering them. There was also some sort of brother betrayal, but it was so shallow and lacking motivation that it isn't really worth discussing. The brother (I think) wanted to have some more action and so he betrayed the king just to lower his weapons and suffer a life sentence afterwards. After slaughtering his own people, everything gets back to normal. And the king who solves all problems with violence decides to share his tech and knowledge to help the world. But not like the whole world, mostly African-american people in the US. I'm sure it's going to be pretty easy, since all technology in this world is done by one genius girl.Then we get the first post-credit scene when BP visits the UN assembly and says that he is ready to share the knowledge with all the nations. I'm pretty sure that we already have a lot of knowledge on slaughtering each other in wars and even civil wars, so his knowledge is not going to make a great difference.Summing it up, we get a weak impotent king to hold his throne. He never cared about anyone besides himself really, the fact that he suggests to heal Killmonger who killed Zuri just for lulz shows that he doesn't care. He never cares about his own people since he never hesitated on killing them personally. Just a little advice, if you wan't to have a good king character, ask Llane Wrynn how to rule.Killmonger was driven by revenge at first, then his motivation turned into some uncertain political position about oppression, but in the end it seems that he just loved his country (but not the people, it seems). The scene where BP suggests that Killmonger can be saved and healed completely destroys all the rivalry and the motivation of both. Anyway, Killmonger and Klaue were the best characters in the movie. The story was nonsense, they achieved nothing , BP leaned nothing and is still a worthless king and a bad leader. Was nice to see Serkis having a lot of fun in this movie, I love that guy and I'd love to see more of him (guess he's tired of playing CGI puppets...Gollum...Gollum).I also loved all the wishful thinking in this movie, which is mostly based on the comic I guess. Advanced native African people with space technology saving the world? Any educated person would suggest you checking South Africa after 1994. Supporting the immigrants in the US? Come on, guys...The good stuff: even though there were just 3 sets of Wakanda I still kinda loved it, the music choice was good, showing all that traditionalism, the nature. Killmonger's scene with his father was gold, I wish we had more dramatic scenes (it was well acted and well executed overall). The sister was kinda cool sometimes, being a more modern character and rejecting the old ways. Even though she's a little too much Mary Sue.Yet the main reason why I still decided to write this is the reviews. This has to stop. And I'm not talking solely about RT 97% which is just ridiculous. It's like people are afraid to judge something impartially cause of getting shamed for being racist or something. Also, this movie started with fair 7.1 on IMDB later to be loaded with >30% of 10 ratings eventually ending up in 7.9 (as of now, I'm sure it will only go up). I'm not saying that IMDB has something to do with this, but this rating surely does not reflect the quality of the movie.Conclusion: don't trust ratings (nor RT or IMDB). If you like it - like it, if you don't - no need to be afraid to say that you didn't like it.You know you've seen a good movie when you exit the theater with something changed inside, an emotion, a thought - BP is not such a movie."

","Chadwick Boseman who played a pair of real live black icons and played them
well makes a reappearance as T'Changa whom we met in Captain American
Civil War. Jackie Robinson and Thurgood Marshall should only have had the
superpowers this guy has. Including a mysterious mineral that gives those who use it some real staying power. Kind of like kryptonite.With technological advances we can sure do more with these superheroes than
could have been done in Hollywood's golden era. But I think the real reason
these films are so popular is that real life isn't providing us with that many
heroes to admire. Sure easier to root for Marvel Comics creation.Anyway Boseman's father died and being the crown prince he's the logical
successor. But in the hidden kingdom of Wakanda you can get challenged.
Something like the way the Klingons choose their leader. Boseman defeats
one challenger, but another one, an exile raised in the mean streets of Oakland played by Michael B. Jordan emerges and he takes over for a bit.
Boseman is down, but not out.Kids and Trekkie types will certainly love this. Not my particular cup of tea,
but it's nicely done and packaged.The only question I have is that if these Wakandans are as powerful as they
are, why weren't the first Arab slave traders repelled let alone European buyers? Seems like that was the time to make their presence known."

","With all the hype surrounding this movie, I must admit that I had expected something extraordinary.However the ""Black Panther"" movie was not all as outstanding as it was cranked up to be. Don't get me wrong here, because I am not saying the movie is bad. Far from it as it was still rather enjoyable. It just wasn't outstanding amidst the many Marvel movies that flood the movie market.The storyline in ""Black Panther"" was adequate, albeit somewhat generic and predictable.The acting in the movie was good and they really had gotten together a great ensemble of actors and actresses to perform in the movie. Personally, then I was most impressed with Andy Serkis, and it was quite nice to see him in person and not doing blue-suit performances.The action was fast paced and well-choreographed, which definitely added to the overall enjoyment of the movie.This being a Marvel superhero movie, of course you expect a grand visual presentation of CGI. And let me just say that the CGI in the movie were great, as they always are in these Marvel superhero movies.All in all, an entertaining enough movie. Although not among the top of superhero movies for me."

Likable rooting characters but in general, there was a lack of interest. The story line felt as if we have seen before. The plot isn't quite as refreshing or unique as originally thought, and at times was somewhat boring.We can see as to how and why many people have considered this film to be overrated and not nearly as great as its critics are founding over. Perhaps this is one of those films where we need to have interest in the culture and overall character landmark to fully feel connected. In the end, one was left disappointed."

In general, this movie is fine, as I have stated earlier, but the truth is that the professional critics have judge this movie for the wrong reasons, they have let their political interests overshadow their ability to rate a movie the way it's supposed to be.In conclusion, this movie is completely overrated, also, definitely not the best movie of the year, not even in the top ten, not even the best movie of superheroes of this year and even though the academy nominated it for best picture it is still overrated. If you want to watch a really good superheroe movie and a really good movie in general I suggest The Dark Knight not Black panther."

","This is my second attempt to review this title. 
I was able to see a screening of this in Europe...waste of time. Predictable and laughable at points, it desperately tries to keep pace with other Marvel offerings but fails miserably. The storyline begins with an extremely promising origin for the characters but instead of capitalizing on this and building on it we move to forced action sequences that are poorly done (horrible CGI). That's where the attempt to keep pace with other Marvel and DC offerings becomes obvious...cliché phrases and over the top reaches to create new ones. Some borrowing from previous Marvel ""technology"" really tried to claim it to it's own, but was sadly obvious. Jordan did an outstanding job portraying Erik Killmonger and Whitaker was great, as always...the rest of the cast fell miles short of bringing these characters to life. It's okay to act with a chip on your shoulder because THAT'S what make hero characters pop...BUT you must act first. As the Marvel scene is beginning to become over saturated, this film at least allows us to take a break from an actual Marvel film.Not good enough to call ""cookie cutter""..."

","Academy award nominee for best picture? All I can say is, if this is the best example of an action film that has been produced that is actually worthy of a nomination for best picture than this has to be one of the worst years (2018) ever in the history of the film making industry. I mean, as far as a Marvel action film goes, this is definitely above average. The generally anticipated saturation of CGI (Computer Graphics Interface) technology was actually bearable, but the fight scenes were dragged out far too long.Try and imagine a John Wayne western fight being dragged out for as long as the last fight in this movie was which takes place between cousins T'Challa / Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and the super buff and shirtless Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan). John Wayne enjoyed a long and illustrious career in many film genres and one of the ways he accomplished that was by making sure none of his fight scenes dragged on too long. So a little advice for my bro's Chadwick and Michael B. ""ya gotta no when to hold 'em, and know when to fold 'em"".Mrs. Shullivan and I liked that the women warriors were all strong, black and beautiful women with a head on their shoulders and did not bend for any man, King or no King. The power struggle to mainatin the rare earth minerals, the civil war between the five (5) tribes, and the earlier scene where the young girls were being treated like cargo vaguely reminds us about what has transpired on the African continent over the past century. But kids won't get it, and adults want to see positive reinforcements without weaponizing the tribes.It's a decent enough Marvel film, but I don't think it will be on my ""repeat"" list to watch anytime soon. I give the film a 6 out of 10 rating. Please don't disappoint us with any further bad choice Academy Award winners."

The entire production was a laughable exercise in nonsense, and the CGI was worse."

","Black Panther, directed by Ryan Coogler, tells the story of the new King T'Challa of Wakanda who must learn to handle the responsibilities of this title. Chadwick Boseman reprises his role as the Black Panther and goes up against his nemesis Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan.Pros:
Coogler has already proven himself to be an excellent director after movies like Fruitvale Station and Creed (both starring Jordan), but he showcases his full talents in Black Panther when given a huge budget to work with. The movie looks beautiful with bright lush colors. The soundtrack and musical score are also very good. At its heart, the movie's message is very profound and relevant to real world politics.As expected, Boseman is awesome as T'Challa. His character goes through so much and his development throughout is handled perfectly. The best scenes of this movie are when he has to look within himself to find answers when the people he always trusted let him down. The cast in general has very good chemistry. T'Challa's relationship with his sister Shuri (Letiitia Wright) is very funny and it's easy to buy them as siblings. His relationship with his love Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) is even better. It would be criminal not to mention Danai Gurira and what she gives this movie from an action standpoint. Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger is without a doubt the best villain the MCU has presented so far. His motivations are so clear and his ideology directly challenges T'Challa's. He is physically and psychologically the perfect adversary for Black Panther. Cons:
The pacing of the movie is a bit odd. It moves pretty quickly until everything comes to a head at the very end. More time should have been spent in between to flesh out the side characters and let the emotions sink in. In addition, the action scenes are not among Marvel's best. The last battle between Panther and Killmonger in particular is pretty disappointing in all honesty. The CGI felt unfinished and they could have been cut together better. Overall, Black Panther is a triumph for the MCU and its societal connotations. This is, in my opinion, the best origin movie that Marvel has made because of its amazing hero, great cast of role characters, and truly menacing villain. Black Panther gets an A."

Not going to happen. For me there is so much effort to preach (as that's what it is) a particular political viewpoint that it totally interferes with story and character development. Because of this I found Black Panther almost unbearable and struggled to make it to the end. Besides that, technically the CGI was wayyyy off and character development severely compromised. Just awful. Possibly the most undeservingly overhyped movie of all time."

Black people are the best race ever we get it, everyone is entitled to there own opinions, just don't push it on the viewers. I appreciate what was trying to be done but everything else is just drowned out by all the BS. And the really crappy character development and poor cgi that plagues the screen, along with all the comic book errors made throughout, like Erik gaining powers from consuming the heart shaped herb. Let me be very clear I absolutely love Chadwick Bozeman as the Black Panther in Civil War, i'm ashamed that not even his talents as an actor, could save this awful mess, and Andy Serkis was awesome as usual, a waste of potential.

I stayed with it to the bitter end but found little to make it unique among its Marvel brotherhood. If anything, it pulled in every cliche one could think of, having a black hero. Maybe the producers will learn from this and bring the guy back. By the way, it didn't deserve all those ""One"" ratings. There were some incredible scenes. It just didn't meld."

Then Tchalla´s mother, sister and girlfriend recover him using the powerful plant destined to Wakanda kings. And T'Challa returns to Wakanda in a coup d'état, destroying the aircrafts sent by Killmonger to the spies. W'Kabi and his army support Killmonger and in the end, it seems that everything is all right in Wakanda that seems to have a great division between the social classes. There is also excessive references to the ""birth of mankind"" in the view of the writer. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Pantera Negra"" (""Black Panther"")"

","I guess, because of the hype, I was expecting ""the best Marvel movie ever,"" or at least ""the best Marvel movie if the year.""I pray to God and Stan Lee that this isn't the best Marvel Movie of 2018.The fact is, there are maybe 3 laughs in the entire film. Three moments where you smile. Three moments where you crack a grin and they all come exclusively from Letitia Wright.And it wasn't because there were jokes and they didn't land. It was really because the movie took itself far too seriously. Like Winter Soldier and Civil War it had a message to tell...but unlike the Captain American movies, it thought its message was so serious that it couldn't laugh even at itself.I think, honestly, it even forgot it was a Marvel movie. In fact at time I think that the director, crew, and cast all thought that they were making ""Roots"" meets the new ""A Birth of a Nation""And Martin Freedman, yeah I think he was only there to prove that he could do a better American accent than his Sherlock counterpart. Maybe it was a bet, which part of the cast of Sherlock can hold an American accent throughout an entire film?And, honestly I am disappointed, because ALL three grins in the film went to Letitia Wright and Martin Freeman has some fairly decent comedic timing...they just didn't let it show. At least not for Freeman or ANYONE ELSE.Honestly, I'm surprised they even let Letitia Wright makes us smile or entertain us an any way.Honestly, it felt a lot like I was watching a college lecture...but a college lecture for a class that has a mandatory attendance policy and a professor that ONLY teaches from the book that he himself wrote...you get that kind of overly-serious pretentious feel to it.And...really, how often do people have to tell other people who they are in this movie? That really happened far too often and not in the ""Bond, James Bond"" way but in the ""If I tell you who I am it's going to give me extra power"" kind of way.And in the end you get two fight scenes by a waterfall that weren't very inspired and failed in comparison to other MCU fights. You get a car chase that was again...uninspired and fell flat but this time in the ""we've seen this before only done better"" kind of way. And a climatic battle that felt a little like the Gungan/Battle Droid battle in The Phantom Menace only with better CGI and an uninspired fight between the two powers rather than the Jedi dual.At least Winter Soldier and Civil War allowed us to laugh and relax a bit during the more serious MCU fair. At least they pulled out the stops when it came to action and, despite the message...tried to deliver something, anything.All this gave us was, well, a lecture and one where the action seemed, well, it seemed like the cast and crew felt they were obligated to give us that and thus did it with disdain.. It felt like all involved thought that entertainment would take away from the preaching.And really, have a message....just please entertain me. I work hard. I already went to school. What I want for the price of admission is to be entertained.If you can't do that, if you only let Letitia Wright make me smile and then only three times in a super hero movie that doesn't wow with action...then you've failed.In fact, you've failed so much that you aren't ""the first Black super-hero movie"" I'm taking that pilfered title and giving it back to Blade...because at least Blade was entertaining."

","First of all before anyone calls me racist on the other side of the screen I am a melinated person. I'm a huge MCU fan too. Black Panther outside of the movie is a cool badass character.Anyways this movie has a great story at the same time it is underwhelming. The acting and costumes were marvelous. Very traditional and technology feel.
But that does not mean it's automatically the best movie or a great movie. Visuals and ""panther"" power is not enough.The over hypeness made this movie look bad. It could have been more dramatic on so many levels. It could have been THE MOVIE but was not.The movie rushes to make Killmonger king who becomes king for less than a day. T'Challa is in a coma for less than a few hours. Then the movie just rushes to a fight and that's about it.This movie lacks drama, dialogue and development. The over hypeness from fans, media and band-wagoners is what kills this movie from being higher than a 5.I suppose Mcu fans and many black people were just ill during the time of the release to notice the flaws of this hash.This movie could be so much more but with the MCU formula we have to settle for subpar movies.Black Panther is one of the most overrated movies of all time . Black Panther isn't the first Black Superhero to make it to the big screen, get that through your head. So where was all this hype coming from? And Why?
Black Panther is not a good movie.I recommend this movie to the brainwashed.Verdict: The Pantah and T'challa are great characters. It's just this movie was hash."

","Wanted to see 'Black Panther' for a while, one of my most anticipated films of this early half of 2018 and as somebody who likes to loves most of Marvel's films. The idea was interesting as was what the film was hyped up to be, the trailer looked great and the high ratings and critical acclaim promised even more. My thoughts were that 'Black Panther' was a decent and intriguing film with a lot of very well done to great elements, but it didn't blow me away and left me disappointed after the hype. As indicated, far from hated it, didn't love it. Actually saw 'Black Panther' on opening weekend in a sold out showing (it was touch and go as to whether a ticket could be gotten), but had to properly form my thoughts for a while and was nervous seeing the very divisive IMDb reaction and the condescension on both sides (mostly negative), which has slightly died down since to feel less nervous.Starting with the good/great things, 'Black Panther' is mostly impressive visually. The special effects were variable, but there were some spectacular ones, while it's beautifully and stylishly shot, slickly edited and sumptuously costumed. It's the extraordinary production design that was most note-worthy. Loved the use of technology, which was really cool. The music has the right amount of haunting intensity, energy, dignity and pathos, so a fine score on its own but not always utilised right in the film, a few ill-fitting moments mood-wise.Much of the action is exciting, though there could have been more, and there is a good deal of thought-provoking script-writing with some nicely injected humour. One is immersed in the world of Wakanda, which is a fascinating world in thematic terms. The story does grip once it gets going and doesn't feel as confused and jumpy, with timeline and location changes needing to be clearer, like it did to begin with and a lot of it even when turning our everyday struggles on their heads is surprisingly relevant. Personally thought that much of the acting was good, with a very charismatic lead performance from Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan bringing a self-loathing conflicted edge and swagger to Killmonger and Andy Serkis relishing his role with aplomb. The women are just as good, with a dignified Lupita Nyong'o, regal, no-nonsense and feisty Danai Gurira and particularly a funny and endearing Letitia Wright. While his role is small, Daniel Kaluuya is great fun in it. Direction is above competent, if not innovative, and really appreciated the film making Killmonger more than the standard Marvel villain, here one with questionable personal motives but one where one can see his point of view and empathise. Although his actions are inconsistent and don't always make sense and he could have been more threatening, generally he is one of the better Marvel villains and the most developed character in a film too full of stock ones (the titular character being the other exception). 'Black Panther' has faults however. Most of the characters are stock and clichéd, while some of the first half is too talky, the film is a little slow-going and confused to start with and some of the political elements are laid on too thick. Adding to the general feel that, even with the splashes of humour, the film takes itself too seriously and with the amount of predictability it has doesn't do enough new with a novel concept. There are exceptions to the cast. Forrest Whittaker is wasted as a non-developed character with too short screen time, on top of the scene being rushed his final scene has no impact as a result. Martin Freeman is too fish out of water as well. Although some of the effects are spectacular, others are very ropy. Especially in the final action scene between Black Panther and Killmonger which resembled a very early days/years video game. That scene also felt rushed, sometimes vaguely choreographed and anti-climactic, though the whole climax felt over-stuffed and too busy. Overall, decent and interesting but was expecting more. Personally don't think it's the best Marvel film, while a long way from bad let alone terrible, for me it's one of the weaker ones. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
" Most overrated MCU movie and extremely generic

","I managed to see this movie again during the weekend, preparing for Captain Marvel, and I felt I had to do a review on this movie. Especially since Cap was such a great movie in comparison.Black Panther is not only the most overrated MCU movie so far, I would go so far as to say it is one of the most overrated movies of all time.
It is not horrible bad per se, it is just so darn boring.
The reason it is so boring is partly because it is super generic - bad guy wants hero´s stuff/title, bad guy fights good guy and ""wins"", good guy comes back reinforced/trained/equipped or with allies and wins in the end. That is it. That is the movie. Which would be fine-ish if the movie had something else to offer, but except for clothing and music, it does not.
The second reason this movie is so boring is because there is no excitment - the movie is so predictable that after 10min I could tell you exactly what would happen. Well, I did not know that the villain, who is the most Hitleresque character I have seen in a movie, had ancestors jumping into the sea dying because they wanted to be free. He was Wakandan, no slaves there.. so what was he talking about?But yes, lets talk villains. Claw was great for the time he was in the movie, and the Rhino dude had decent motivation so okay I will buy that. But the main villain of the story want to spread weapons, conquer, and save people that ""look like him"". All in a nationalistic very neo-fascist fashion. Almost all of his speaches mimic Hitler, if you do not believe me, check out a clip of Hitler and compare. Uncanny likeness. And this is a villain so many can relate to? Weird.Something else that stod out was the bad CGi, what happen Marvel? Why suddenly so bad computer graphics? The two CGi suits fighting in the end took me so far out of the movie that I starting to think of what to eat for lunch the day after.And finally this is the most political Marvel movie to date. In some aspects I both expected it and can think it is necessary - it is very hard to talk Africa in this context and not mention slavery. HOWEVER, In the MCU, Wakanda is located just north of Lake Turkana, at a point bordering Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, and South Sudan. Do you know who took slaves there historically? It was not white men, nor christians... so... why was that not mention?
And the wall thingie at the end, was that really necessary? Felt out of place, out of character, and too much on the nose.I give this a 3/10, and I think Black Panther is the second or third worst Marvel movie so far. As part of that universe it should perhaps not be overlooked by fans, but otherwise I cannot recommend this at all. So, so boring movie. Even The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, all of the Thor movies, hell even Justice League, was more fun then this. Not bad, just bland, boring, predictable, extremely generic, and did I mention boring?"
" Disappointing

2/10
","This was supposed to be the newest and best Marvel movie. It was also supposed to be deeper than a super hero movie. Well, basically all they did was put African-Americans in the role of the main characters and followed the same exact formula of every other Marvel movie ever created. The action was mediocre at best. The villain was good, but at the point when he truly started to flesh out his character, I was bored and realized I was watching a movie. I literally said what was going to happen about 30 minutes before it happened. Now if you like super hero films, which I happen to not but if you do I am sure you will have fun and enjoy this film. But, in my opinion this movie had th intensity of a haircut and was a boring commercial to sell toys."
" Meh, highly overrated - not even close to ""the best"" Marvel movie

","The cinematography of this film was just OK with some obvious bad CGI, and one would come to expect something better from a Marvel superhero film (as shown by the budget). The directing was fairly decent.The story was ok, but nothing overly exciting. Way too much spotlight on the Black Panther conflict here. I feel the story would have been better told had there been another villain. The acting also seemed either way too overboard for some of the characters, while others under-performed.Nevertheless, enjoyable, but certainly not even close to ""the best"" Marvel movie. It's only a 6/10 from me."

","With all the hype surrounding this movie (excellent trailers, Kendrick-curated soundtrack, all-African cast) I thought I was in for something special with Black Panther, as while they aren't remotely the highest quality movies, the Marvel cinematic universe movies are generally pretty entertaining. As it turns out I was wrong, Black Panther was extremely average, I have no idea what these critics/review bots are talking about when they say that it is the best Marvel movie and worthy of ""critical"" praise (as not just a super hero movie but as a movie in general.)Things that I liked:
Effort put into aesthetic authenticity of the African elements of the movie - within the Marvel universe the look and feel of the movie was unique and you can tell care was taken in this regard.Andy Serkis - My favorite character by far, was probably the only person who didnt seem like he was reading from a script sheet and got some genuine laughs out of me.Things that I didn't like:
The story was extremely predictable and to be honest I don't know if the most virtuous resolution was reached in the climax. Michael B Jordan's character had fairly reasonable intentions for wanting to kill the Black Panther and take his place in Wakanda as he had been abandoned, with seemingly no family, to live in the ghettos of Oakland. However, his whole plan to give advanced Wakandan weaponry to every African person in the world so they could kill and overthrow people in power who weren't African was extremely ""on-the-chin"" in terms of its narrative motivations within the current climate. It wasn't remotely clever or nuanced and really unbalanced his character, his motivations were understandable but his plan was moronic. Additionally, who didn't see Black Panther surviving his fall? Who didn't see the Gorilla tribe coming to the rescue at the end? The entire movie was so bland and predictable I wanted it to be over well before the end - I didn't even stay for the post credit scenes...The acting was very wooden - Not a lot to say here really, some really poor line delivery from the cast across the board except for Andy Serkis. No one was particularly charismatic, the main character for instance was extremely boring.The script was very robotic - This ties into the poor acting, but perhaps as a result of the script, some of the actors never really had a chance to bring their characters to life.The characters - I have already addressed the mess that was Michael B Jordan's character Warmonger(?). Basically throughout the entire movie you never really learn anything or see anything of the Black Panther's character, he basically moves from one place to another showing no emotion and just either smashes things or asks people questions. Apparently the character is supposed to be very intelligent, while it was probably a narrative choice, the Black Panther in this movie seemed like an emotionless Jarhead whose only really characteristic was that he get nervous around his girlfriend... The women in this movie had a bit of attitude and charisma and shouldn't be blanketed down with the Black Panther and Warmonger as bad characters, but they didnt really get a chance to shine and really only contributed a few one liners and a bit of fighting.The action - Shaky-cam rubbish, the action in the movie is terrible and not remotely on the level of the well-choreographed fighting in say Captain America Winter Soldier - please for the love of god show someone getting punched or kicked without having to cut the shot 5 times. There is an action sequence at the start which basically flagposted what the action was going to be like, it is shot at night and you basically cant see bloody anything...The CGI - Honestly, the CGI in Black Panther felt extrmely overused and was surprisingly quite bad. It really took me out of some scenes because the environments and effects looked average (not quite Justice League bad but not far off). It is obvious in scenes in Wakanda, for instance, where the plains/mountains are in the background but they are clearly filming in front of a green screen. Some of the effects just looked silly and got laughs out of me and my party. I personally though the Rhinos were stupid...The Soundtrack - After all the hype surrounding Kendrick Lamar curating a soundtrack for the movie, the tracks from that album barely feature at all. They faintly play from some cars and stuff here and there and a couple feature in some action scenes but I though we would be watching some decent action scenes with some bass heavy Kendrick blasting along to the fighting. Alas, no dice. The orchestral score is also quite average, coming in strong at weird moments and being quite out of place in certain places, there are a couple of moments where it seems like some sort of fairy, Harry Potter, Narnia music that just doesn't fit the scene.Overall I think this is probably one of the weaker Marvel movies, avoiding honest criticism because of the hype surrounding it. The basic components of the film are all poor-average, with the only real 5+/10 aspect being the aesthetics of Wakanda and its people. Like I said above, I wanted to leave well before it was over because I knew the action was probably not going to improve from nauseating shaky-cam and I knew how it was all going to play out."
" Wishful thinking / Broken ratings / Longread

","First, this movie has a lot of pointless scenes that achieve nothing, the museum scene with pointless covert operation ending up in killing everyone anyway, that's so not Silent Assassin. The 007 Bond casino scene was just there to establish the most worthless character in movie history - Everett K. Ross. After the capture of Klaue (surprisingly surviving a horrible car crash), we get another pointless scene where Killmonger and his girlfriend re-capture Klaue just to kill him again for no reason. Killmonger never actually needed Klaue in the first place, so killing him was as pointless as freeing him out. Killmonger also kills his GF for no particular reason yet again. He could've easily get to Wakanda anyway since he has the royal tattoo (they also gave those to vampire servants in Blade). Then Killmonger and Black Panther participate in previously established variety of local Mak'Gora (election process I guess). Black Panther fails miserably and the new stronger king takes the throne, the end, right? No. They actually want you to root for the most useless and impotent king ever. Killmonger then says something stupid about colonization and oppression, and decides to use the Vibranium weapons (produced solely by a 16 y.o. girl mastermind) to conquer the world. So he's like pro-anti-colonization or something, you tell me. Yet he is betrayed by his people (Okoye literally says she will stay loyal to the king and in 5 minutes betrays the new king) and they all happily participate in a civil war slaughter until Killmonger gets killed. Also love how they intercepted their own ships with their own people, just murdering them. There was also some sort of brother betrayal, but it was so shallow and lacking motivation that it isn't really worth discussing. The brother (I think) wanted to have some more action and so he betrayed the king just to lower his weapons and suffer a life sentence afterwards. After slaughtering his own people, everything gets back to normal. And the king who solves all problems with violence decides to share his tech and knowledge to help the world. But not like the whole world, mostly African-american people in the US. I'm sure it's going to be pretty easy, since all technology in this world is done by one genius girl.Then we get the first post-credit scene when BP visits the UN assembly and says that he is ready to share the knowledge with all the nations. I'm pretty sure that we already have a lot of knowledge on slaughtering each other in wars and even civil wars, so his knowledge is not going to make a great difference.Summing it up, we get a weak impotent king to hold his throne. He never cared about anyone besides himself really, the fact that he suggests to heal Killmonger who killed Zuri just for lulz shows that he doesn't care. He never cares about his own people since he never hesitated on killing them personally. Just a little advice, if you wan't to have a good king character, ask Llane Wrynn how to rule.Killmonger was driven by revenge at first, then his motivation turned into some uncertain political position about oppression, but in the end it seems that he just loved his country (but not the people, it seems). The scene where BP suggests that Killmonger can be saved and healed completely destroys all the rivalry and the motivation of both. Anyway, Killmonger and Klaue were the best characters in the movie. The story was nonsense, they achieved nothing , BP leaned nothing and is still a worthless king and a bad leader. Was nice to see Serkis having a lot of fun in this movie, I love that guy and I'd love to see more of him (guess he's tired of playing CGI puppets...Gollum...Gollum).I also loved all the wishful thinking in this movie, which is mostly based on the comic I guess. Advanced native African people with space technology saving the world? Any educated person would suggest you checking South Africa after 1994. Supporting the immigrants in the US? Come on, guys...The good stuff: even though there were just 3 sets of Wakanda I still kinda loved it, the music choice was good, showing all that traditionalism, the nature. Killmonger's scene with his father was gold, I wish we had more dramatic scenes (it was well acted and well executed overall). The sister was kinda cool sometimes, being a more modern character and rejecting the old ways. Even though she's a little too much Mary Sue.Yet the main reason why I still decided to write this is the reviews. This has to stop. And I'm not talking solely about RT 97% which is just ridiculous. It's like people are afraid to judge something impartially cause of getting shamed for being racist or something. Also, this movie started with fair 7.1 on IMDB later to be loaded with >30% of 10 ratings eventually ending up in 7.9 (as of now, I'm sure it will only go up). I'm not saying that IMDB has something to do with this, but this rating surely does not reflect the quality of the movie.Conclusion: don't trust ratings (nor RT or IMDB). If you like it - like it, if you don't - no need to be afraid to say that you didn't like it.You know you've seen a good movie when you exit the theater with something changed inside, an emotion, a thought - BP is not such a movie."

","Chadwick Boseman who played a pair of real live black icons and played them
well makes a reappearance as T'Changa whom we met in Captain American
Civil War. Jackie Robinson and Thurgood Marshall should only have had the
superpowers this guy has. Including a mysterious mineral that gives those who use it some real staying power. Kind of like kryptonite.With technological advances we can sure do more with these superheroes than
could have been done in Hollywood's golden era. But I think the real reason
these films are so popular is that real life isn't providing us with that many
heroes to admire. Sure easier to root for Marvel Comics creation.Anyway Boseman's father died and being the crown prince he's the logical
successor. But in the hidden kingdom of Wakanda you can get challenged.
Something like the way the Klingons choose their leader. Boseman defeats
one challenger, but another one, an exile raised in the mean streets of Oakland played by Michael B. Jordan emerges and he takes over for a bit.
Boseman is down, but not out.Kids and Trekkie types will certainly love this. Not my particular cup of tea,
but it's nicely done and packaged.The only question I have is that if these Wakandans are as powerful as they
are, why weren't the first Arab slave traders repelled let alone European buyers? Seems like that was the time to make their presence known."

","With all the hype surrounding this movie, I must admit that I had expected something extraordinary.However the ""Black Panther"" movie was not all as outstanding as it was cranked up to be. Don't get me wrong here, because I am not saying the movie is bad. Far from it as it was still rather enjoyable. It just wasn't outstanding amidst the many Marvel movies that flood the movie market.The storyline in ""Black Panther"" was adequate, albeit somewhat generic and predictable.The acting in the movie was good and they really had gotten together a great ensemble of actors and actresses to perform in the movie. Personally, then I was most impressed with Andy Serkis, and it was quite nice to see him in person and not doing blue-suit performances.The action was fast paced and well-choreographed, which definitely added to the overall enjoyment of the movie.This being a Marvel superhero movie, of course you expect a grand visual presentation of CGI.

Likable rooting characters but in general, there was a lack of interest. The story line felt as if we have seen before. The plot isn't quite as refreshing or unique as originally thought, and at times was somewhat boring.We can see as to how and why many people have considered this film to be overrated and not nearly as great as its critics are founding over. Perhaps this is one of those films where we need to have interest in the culture and overall character landmark to fully feel connected. In the end, one was left disappointed."

In general, this movie is fine, as I have stated earlier, but the truth is that the professional critics have judge this movie for the wrong reasons, they have let their political interests overshadow their ability to rate a movie the way it's supposed to be.In conclusion, this movie is completely overrated, also, definitely not the best movie of the year, not even in the top ten, not even the best movie of superheroes of this year and even though the academy nominated it for best picture it is still overrated. If you want to watch a really good superheroe movie and a really good movie in general I suggest The Dark Knight not Black panther."

I was able to see a screening of this in Europe...waste of time. Predictable and laughable at points, it desperately tries to keep pace with other Marvel offerings but fails miserably. The storyline begins with an extremely promising origin for the characters but instead of capitalizing on this and building on it we move to forced action sequences that are poorly done (horrible CGI). That's where the attempt to keep pace with other Marvel and DC offerings becomes obvious...cliché phrases and over the top reaches to create new ones. Some borrowing from previous Marvel ""technology"" really tried to claim it to it's own, but was sadly obvious. Jordan did an outstanding job portraying Erik Killmonger and Whitaker was great, as always...the rest of the cast fell miles short of bringing these characters to life. It's okay to act with a chip on your shoulder because THAT'S what make hero characters pop...BUT you must act first. As the Marvel scene is beginning to become over saturated, this film at least allows us to take a break from an actual Marvel film.Not good enough to call ""cookie cutter""..."

","Academy award nominee for best picture? All I can say is, if this is the best example of an action film that has been produced that is actually worthy of a nomination for best picture than this has to be one of the worst years (2018) ever in the history of the film making industry. I mean, as far as a Marvel action film goes, this is definitely above average. The generally anticipated saturation of CGI (Computer Graphics Interface) technology was actually bearable, but the fight scenes were dragged out far too long.Try and imagine a John Wayne western fight being dragged out for as long as the last fight in this movie was which takes place between cousins T'Challa / Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and the super buff and shirtless Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan). John Wayne enjoyed a long and illustrious career in many film genres and one of the ways he accomplished that was by making sure none of his fight scenes dragged on too long. So a little advice for my bro's Chadwick and Michael B. ""ya gotta no when to hold 'em, and know when to fold 'em"".Mrs. Shullivan and I liked that the women warriors were all strong, black and beautiful women with a head on their shoulders and did not bend for any man, King or no King. The power struggle to mainatin the rare earth minerals, the civil war between the five (5) tribes, and the earlier scene where the young girls were being treated like cargo vaguely reminds us about what has transpired on the African continent over the past century. But kids won't get it, and adults want to see positive reinforcements without weaponizing the tribes.It's a decent enough Marvel film, but I don't think it will be on my ""repeat"" list to watch anytime soon. I give the film a 6 out of 10 rating. Please don't disappoint us with any further bad choice Academy Award winners."

","Black Panther, directed by Ryan Coogler, tells the story of the new King T'Challa of Wakanda who must learn to handle the responsibilities of this title. Chadwick Boseman reprises his role as the Black Panther and goes up against his nemesis Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan.Pros:
Coogler has already proven himself to be an excellent director after movies like Fruitvale Station and Creed (both starring Jordan), but he showcases his full talents in Black Panther when given a huge budget to work with. The movie looks beautiful with bright lush colors. The soundtrack and musical score are also very good. At its heart, the movie's message is very profound and relevant to real world politics.As expected, Boseman is awesome as T'Challa. His character goes through so much and his development throughout is handled perfectly. The best scenes of this movie are when he has to look within himself to find answers when the people he always trusted let him down. The cast in general has very good chemistry. T'Challa's relationship with his sister Shuri (Letiitia Wright) is very funny and it's easy to buy them as siblings. His relationship with his love Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) is even better. It would be criminal not to mention Danai Gurira and what she gives this movie from an action standpoint. Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger is without a doubt the best villain the MCU has presented so far. His motivations are so clear and his ideology directly challenges T'Challa's. He is physically and psychologically the perfect adversary for Black Panther. Cons:
The pacing of the movie is a bit odd. It moves pretty quickly until everything comes to a head at the very end. More time should have been spent in between to flesh out the side characters and let the emotions sink in. In addition, the action scenes are not among Marvel's best. The last battle between Panther and Killmonger in particular is pretty disappointing in all honesty. The CGI felt unfinished and they could have been cut together better. Overall, Black Panther is a triumph for the MCU and its societal connotations. This is, in my opinion, the best origin movie that Marvel has made because of its amazing hero, great cast of role characters, and truly menacing villain. Black Panther gets an A."

The source of the population vast wealth, and advanced technology is an ancient cosmic metal called 'nonsenseanium' The plot is poor, the acting is wooden, with no humour and hardly any action. We see how the 'Lion King Simba' rip-off becomes king and is challenged by the 'Scar' rip-off for his throne. The film has been over-hyped and not as good as the reviews lead you to believe, it appears that reviews are being cautious of giving honest criticism in fear of being called racist!I didn't much like Wonder Woman either, but this isn't even as good as that.

Not going to happen. For me there is so much effort to preach (as that's what it is) a particular political viewpoint that it totally interferes with story and character development. Because of this I found Black Panther almost unbearable and struggled to make it to the end. Besides that, technically the CGI was wayyyy off and character development severely compromised. Just awful. Possibly the most undeservingly overhyped movie of all time."

","Black Panther was the very first black superhero in any main stream comic book to date appearing in 1966, obviously it was a big deal.As a white male, I absolutely love this character, the one from the comics I mean, and not the MCU version, mainly because of all the political agendas that are strewn through the picture, All I can say is enough is enough. Black people are the best race ever we get it, everyone is entitled to there own opinions, just don't push it on the viewers. I appreciate what was trying to be done but everything else is just drowned out by all the BS. And the really crappy character development and poor cgi that plagues the screen, along with all the comic book errors made throughout, like Erik gaining powers from consuming the heart shaped herb. Let me be very clear I absolutely love Chadwick Bozeman as the Black Panther in Civil War, i'm ashamed that not even his talents as an actor, could save this awful mess, and Andy Serkis was awesome as usual, a waste of potential. Overall it has decent moments here and there, but nothing new or relevant, not a good movie period."
